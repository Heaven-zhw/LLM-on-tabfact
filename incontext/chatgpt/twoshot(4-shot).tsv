1	Refuted. According to the table, the "The Witchfinder" episode is the seventh episode of the series and was aired on November 7th, while "Sweet Dreams" is the tenth episode and was aired on November 28th. Therefore, the statement "the Sweet Dreams episode happens later in the series than The Witchfinder" is incorrect.

According to the table, David Moore directed three episodes of series 2 of Merlin: "The Curse of Cornelius Sigan" (row 2), "Lancelot and Guinevere" (row 5), and "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" (row 6). Therefore, the statement "David Moore directed three episodes of series 2 of Merlin" is supported by the table.
3	Supported. According to row 10 of the table, "The Lady of the Lake" episode had the most UK viewers with 6.3 million. Therefore, the statement "the Lady of the Lake episode had the most UK viewers" is supported by the table.
4	Supported. According to the table, only one episode of Merlin (Series 2) was written by Lucy Watkins, which is "Sweet Dreams" (row 11). Therefore, the statement that "Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode of Series 2" is supported.
5	Supported. According to the table, "Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)" (row 7) had 6.14 million UK viewers, while "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" (row 6) had 5.53 million UK viewers.

6	Refuted. According to the table, "Sweet Dreams" is the 10th episode of the series and "The Witchfinder" is the 7th episode. Therefore, "The Witchfinder" happens earlier in the series than "Sweet Dreams."
7	Refuted. According to the table, David Moore directed three episodes (episodes 14, 17, and 18) of series 2 of Merlin. Therefore, the statement "David Moore directed five episodes of series 2 of Merlin" is incorrect.

9	Refuted. According to the table, the column "written by" does not show that Lucy Watkins wrote six episodes of series 2. In fact, she is only credited with writing one episode, which is "Sweet Dreams" and it is listed on row 11 of the table. Therefore, the statement "Lucy Watkins only wrote six episodes of series 2" is not supported by the given table.
10	Refuted. According to row 6 and row 7 of the table, "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" had 5.53 million UK viewers, while "Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)" had 6.14 million UK viewers. Therefore, the statement "Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) had less UK viewers than Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" is false.
11	Refuted. The table provides information on the number of goals scored by players in different competitions but there is no mention of a league 4. Additionally, there is no information about whether the four players who have scored three goals each belong to a specific league or not. Therefore, the statement "four players scored three goals total, and all four are in league 4" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
12	Refuted. The table provides the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, and super cup but does not provide the information on goals scored in the Belgian Cup. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Jonathan Legear scored more or fewer goals than Matias Suarez in the Belgian Cup from the given table.
13	Unsupported. The table does not provide information related to the Belgian Cup or the goals scored in the competition. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether Jonathan Legear scored more goals than the other players combined.

15	Refuted. The given table only provides the number of goals (or points) scored by each player in the league, title playoff, and super cup. It does not include the number of goals scored in total throughout the season or by the top scorer. Therefore, this statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.

17	Refuted. The table only provides information on the number of goals each player scored in the league, title playoff and super cup competitions for the 2008-2009 season for R.S.C. Anderlecht. It does not include information about other players in the Belgian First Division A league who played in the Belgian cup during this season. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether Thomas Chatelle scored more goals than Matias Suarez because there is no information about Suarez's performance in the Belgian Cup.
18	Not supported. There is no information in the table regarding the number of goals scored by Lucas Biglia or any other player in the Belgian Cup. The table only provides the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, super cup, and the total number of goals they scored across all three competitions.
19	Cannot be determined. The table does not provide information about the performances of Jelle Van Damme or any of the players in the UEFA Champions League. The table only lists the number of goals scored in the league and other competitions for R.S.C. Anderlecht during the 2008-2009 season.
20	Refuted. The table provided doesn't provide any information about the number of goals scored by either Matias Suarez or Bart Goor.

22	Refuted. According to the table, only one person, Curtis Strange, scored under par for the tournament and he is from the United States. While it is true that the top five performers are all from the United States, this statement specifically refers to players who scored under par, and therefore the statement is not supported by the table.
23	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, Masashi Ozaki from Japan scored a total of 281, which matches the average score given in the statement. However, it is unclear whether this applies to all players from Japan as only one player from Japan participated in the tournament.

Therefore, the statement that "the most amount of money won by someone from Wales is 67823" is supported by the table.
26	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, Brian Claar (United States) is in fifth place. Since there are three golfers who tied for second place (Chip Beck, Mark McCumber, and Ian Woosnam), all of whom are from different countries (United States, United States, and Wales, respectively), the statement "three of the people tied for fifth place are from the United States" is supported by the table.
27	Refuted. According to the table, there are only two players who scored over par, and both of them are not from the United States. Masashi Ozaki from Japan scored +1 and Scott Simpson also scored +1. Therefore, the statement "a majority of people who scored over par are from the United States" is refuted by the table.
28	Refuted. There is no player from Japan with a score of 251 in the table. The lowest score from a Japanese player (Masashi Ozaki) was 281, which is much higher than 251. Therefore, the statement "the average score for players from Japan is 251" is refuted by the table.
29	Supported. According to the table, there were players from 5 different countries - United States, Wales, Japan, Spain, and 9 players including Ian Woosnam did not represent any of the other countries stated, hence the statement "there are a total of five countries represented by the players" is supported by the table.

39	Refuted. According to the table, the number of players drafted in each round is not consistent. For example, in round 4, only one player (David Laliberte) was drafted, whereas in round 6, two players (Ladislav Scurko and Frederik Cabana) were drafted. Therefore, the statement that "two players were drafted in each round between rounds 3 and 9" is not supported by the table.
40	Unsupported. The statement does not specify which player it is referring to as "the other player drafted in his round." Furthermore, the positions of the players listed in the table are not in an organized manner to indicate which player was drafted in which round. Therefore, it is unclear which player the statement is referring to, and thus whether or not Triston Grant plays the same position as that player.
41	Supported. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy beer won prizes at five different competitions between 1995 and 2009.

44	Refuted. According to the table, more than three of West Berkshire Brewery's beers won awards between 1995 and 2009.

45	Supported.

47	Refuted. According to row 3 of the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer beer won runner-up prize for beer of the festival in a CAMRA Northamptonshire branch beer festival in 1997. Therefore, the statement that the beer has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009 is incorrect.

According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal in every competition it was entered into between 2002 and 2006, and also won a gold medal in the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2003. However, it did not win a medal in the other competitions it was entered into in 1995, 2004, and 2008. Therefore, the statement that Maggs Magnificent Mild has won a gold medal every single instance in which it won a prize between 1995 and 2009 is not entirely accurate.
49	Refuted. The West Berkshire Brewery's beer, Maggs Magnificent Mild, received a gold award in the Mild and Porter category of the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005, as well as a gold award in the Mild category of the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival in 2005.

52	Supported. According to the table, the game at the Fedexforum in Memphis took place on April 10 (row 6) and the game at the Target Center in Minnesota took place on April 11 (row 7). Since the date for the game in Minnesota is after the date for the game in Memphis, it can be concluded that the game at the Target Center took place after the game at Fedexforum, supporting the statement.
53	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against Minnesota (18478) was higher than the attendance for the game against New Orleans (17781). Therefore, the statement "the game against Minnesota had a higher attendance than the game against New Orleans" is supported by the table.
54	Refuted. According to the table, the game against New Orleans on April 8th had an attendance of 17,781, which is the lowest attendance among all the games listed. Therefore, the statement that the game against New Orleans didn't have the highest attendance is true, but it could also be stated that it had the lowest attendance.
55	Refuted. According to the table, the attendance for the game against Golden State is missing, so it cannot be determined whether they had the same attendance as Memphis and New Orleans. Therefore, the statement "Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans all had the same attendance" is not supported by the table.
56	Supported. According to the table, the highest attendance was recorded at the Target Center, which was the location of the April 11 game against Minnesota, where the attendance was 18,478. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendance was at the Target Center" is supported by the table.

60	Refuted. According to rows 4 and 5 of the table, Dagmar Lurz of West Germany was ranked 4th, while Emi Watanabe of Japan was ranked 3rd in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. Therefore, the statement that Emi Watanabe was ranked one place higher than Dagmar Lurz is incorrect.
61	Supported. According to the table, the highest score was 186.92 (achieved by Linda Fratianne of the United States) and the lowest score was 112.28 (achieved by Gloria Mas of Spain). Therefore, the point difference between the highest score and the lowest score is 186.92 - 112.28 = 74.64, which confirms the statement.
62	Supported. According to row 2 and row 3 of the table, Linda Fratianne representing the United States was ranked in first place with a score of 186.92 and Anett Pötzsch representing East Germany was ranked in second place with a score of 184.36 in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships.

63	Supported. According to row 25 of the table, Bodil Olsson was from Sweden, not from Switzerland. In addition, according to row 26, Bodil Olsson received 23 Sp + FS, not 27 as mentioned in the statement. Thus, the statement "Bodil Olsson was not from Switzerland and did not receive 27 SP + FS" is supported by the table.
64	Unclear. The table provides information about the rankings and scores of the competitors in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. It does not provide any information about who won or lost the competition. As such, the statement about who lost the championship is outside the scope of this table.

66	Refuted. According to the table, the highest score was 186.92 (achieved by Linda Fratianne), and the lowest score was 112.28 (achieved by Gloria Mas). Therefore, the point difference between the highest and lowest scores was 74.64 (186.92 - 112.28), not 64.64.
67	Refuted. According to the table, Linda Fratianne finished in first place with a score of 186.92 (row 2), and Anett Pötzsch finished in second place with a score of 184.36 (row 3), which means she did manage to get in the top 3.

70	Supported. According to the table, West Germany had two of the top six skaters in the competition with Norbert Schramm in fourth place and Stephan Bril in sixth place. However, none of the West German skaters won a medal, as the top three ranked skaters were from the United States, Japan, and Canada respectively. Therefore, the statement "West Germany had two of the top six but did not have anyone win a medal" is supported by the table.
71	Refuted. According to the table, Pierre Lamine has 150.5 points and Shinji Someya has 150.34 points. The difference is not 0.16 but 0.16 less than 0.5, which is the difference between their scores. Therefore, the statement that Pierre Lamine has a mere 0.16 more points than Shinji Someya is incorrect.
72	Supported. According to the table, Patrice Macrez of France finished in 7th place and Pierre Lamine of France finished in 8th place, which indicates that France's competitors did indeed finish in consecutive positions of 7th and 8th respectively.

Therefore, Mark Cockerell did not finish with a worse score than Patrice Macrez, and the statement is not supported by the table.
75	Partially Supported. While it is true that West Germany had two athletes in the top six (Norbert Schramm in 4th place and Stephan Bril in 6th place), they did not win a gold medal in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships.

Therefore, the statement that "the gap between first and last was less than 50 points" is incorrect.
79	Refuted. The table shows the score of the games played by Detroit Red Wings, but there is no indication that they had the highest visitor score. Additionally, the scores given in the table are not measured in points; they represent the number of goals scored by each team. Therefore, the statement "Detroit had the highest visitor score, with 5 points" is both unsupported and incorrect.
80	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Detroit scored 6 points as the home team against Nashville, which is the highest home team score in the table. Therefore, the statement "Detroit had the highest home team score, at 6 points" is supported by the table.

82	Supported. According to the table, the highest attendance of 20066 occurred on six different dates: January 3rd, January 5th, January 7th, January 14th, January 16th, and January 31st. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendances were 20066, occurring on 6 dates" is supported by the table.
83	Refuted. The table shows dates, scores, attendance, and record of Detroit Red Wings in various matches but it does not provide the points gap between Detroit Red Wings and other teams. Therefore, the statement that "the highest point gap was on January 5, with a spread of 6 points" cannot be supported or refuted by this table.
84	Refuted. The table provides the scores for all the games that Detroit played during the 2003-04 NHL season, both as a visitor and as a home team. Since the statement doesn't specify which game or games are being referred to, it's not possible to determine if Detroit had one of the lowest visitor scores overall during the season.
85	Refuted. The table only shows the scores of the Detroit Red Wings and their opponents, but it does not provide information about the scores of other home teams during the 2003-04 season. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the table whether Detroit tied for the highest home team score or not.
86	Refuted. The table doesn't provide enough information to support or refute this statement as it only includes scores of games played by Detroit during specific dates in January. The table doesn't contain information about the scores of other teams, so it cannot provide data on whether Detroit was the lowest-scoring team in the league.
87	Supported. According to the table, the attendance rate of 20,066 occurs in 6 out of the 14 games listed (rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 15). Therefore, the statement that the low attendance rate of 20,066 occurred multiple times is supported by the data in the table.
88	Unsupported. The table does not provide information about the point gap for each game or how it evolved during the season. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there were two ties for the largest point gap during the season from the information provided in the table.
89	Supported. According to the table, the term start for Vilson Ahmeti was on December 10, 1991, while the term start for Bashkim Fino was on March 11, 1997, which is after Ahmeti's term start date.

Therefore, the term end for Ylli Bufi was after the term end for Vilson Ahmeti, and the statement is incorrect.
92	Refuted. The table doesn't provide information about whether Sali Berisha was the first member of the Democratic Party of Albania to be elected to office.

95	Refuted. According to the table, Ylli Bufi and Aleksandër Meksi were not members of the Democratic Party of Albania (DPA). In addition, Bashkim Fino and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were members of the Socialist Party of Albania (SPA), not the DPA. Therefore, the statement that Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were all members of the DPA is incorrect.
96	Supported. According to the table, the term end for Ylli Bufi was December 10, 1991, and the term end for Aleksandër Meksi was March 11, 1997. Therefore, the term end for Aleksandër Meksi was indeed after the term end for Ylli Bufi.

98	Refuted. According to the table, multiple people have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania, including Fatos Nano, Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Pandeli Majko, and Ilir Meta. Therefore, the statement "only one person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania" is false.
99	Supported. According to the table, there were two players with the last name Dawkins who played for Utah Jazz - Darryl Dawkins (center) in 1987-88 and Paul Dawkins (guard) in 1979-80. However, their time on the team did not overlap as they played in different seasons.
100	Refuted. According to the table, Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz for only one year in 1979-80, whereas Darryl Dawkins played for the team in 1987-88, which is seven years after Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz. Therefore, the statement that "Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz seven years before Darryl Dawkins" is refuted by the table.
101	Refuted. According to the table, Adrian Dantley played for the Utah Jazz from 1979 to 1986, while Brad Davis played for the Jazz only in 1979-1980. Therefore, Dantley was not on the team for the entire time that Davis was.
102	Supported. According to the table, James Donaldson had two separate stints on the Utah Jazz roster, in 1993 and again in 1994-1995. Therefore, the statement that "James Donaldson had two stints on the Jazz's roster" is supported by the table.
103	Supported. According to the table, the Utah Jazz had at least three guards on the team during the 1979-80 season: Brad Davis (row 3), Paul Dawkins (row 5), and Greg Deane (row 6). Therefore, the statement "the jazz had at least three guards that were on the team 1979-80" is supported by the table.
104	Refuted. According to the table, there were two players with last name Dawkins, but only one of them, Darryl Dawkins, played for the Utah Jazz during the years 1987-88. Therefore, there were not two players with the last name Dawkins on the team at any time, so the statement that they did not overlap is not applicable.
105	Refuted. According to the table, Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz for only one year (1987-88), while Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz for only one year as well (1979-80). Therefore, the statement that Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz seven years before Paul Dawkins is incorrect.
106	Refuted. According to the table, Adrian Dantley played for the Utah Jazz from 1979-1986, while Brad Davis only played for the team in 1979-80, which means they were only on the team together for one season. Therefore, the statement that Adrian Dantley was on the team for the entire time that Brad Davis was on the team and surpassed him by four additional years is incorrect.
107	Refuted. According to row 7 of the table, James Donaldson had two stints on the Jazz's roster, but the table shows that he played for the Jazz during 1993 and then again in 1994-95, which equals two years and not five. Therefore, the statement that he had two stints totaling five years is incorrect.
108	Refuted. According to the table, the Jazz had two guards on the roster during the 1979-80 season: Brad Davis and Paul Dawkins. James Donaldson did not join the team until 1993. Therefore, the statement "the Jazz had at least three guards that were on the team during 1979-80, one being James Donaldson" is refuted by the table.
109	Refuted. The table shows that The Open Championship has seven events, while the Masters Tournament, the US Open, and the PGA Championship have two, two, and six events respectively. Therefore, the statement "The Open Championship is the tournament with the highest number of events" is incorrect as per the given table.
110	Supported. According to the table, Brian Watts did not win any of the tournaments listed in the table (Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship). Therefore, the statement that "none of the tournaments resulted in a win for Brian Watts" is supported by the table.
111	Refuted. According to the table, the PGA Championship had 4 cuts made and the US Open had 1 cut made. Therefore, the statement "the PGA Championship had three more cuts made than the US Open" is incorrect as the PGA Championship had three more cuts made than the US Open.
112	Refuted. The table does not provide enough information to determine the average number of events for the tournaments listed. Therefore, the statement "all the tournaments listed had an average of 2.5 events" cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
113	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts played in 2 Masters Tournaments, but did not achieve a top-25 finish in either of them. Therefore, the statement that he did not make the top-25 at the Masters Tournament is supported by the table.
114	Refuted. According to the table, Brian Watts participated in 7 events at The Open Championship, which is the tournament with his highest number of events. Therefore, the statement "for Brian Watts, The Open Championship is the tournament with his second-highest number of events" is refuted.
115	Refuted. According to the table, Brian Watts did not win any major tournaments, as his wins column shows "0" for each of the four major championships (Masters, US Open, The Open, and PGA Championship). Therefore, the statement that "Brian Watts won exactly one major tournament" is false.
116	Refuted. The statement cannot be verified or refuted because the given table doesn't explicitly mention the number of cuts made in the PGA Championship and the US Open by Brian Watts. Therefore, it would be best to say that there is no information presented in the table to support or refute the given statement.
117	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts only participated in the Masters Tournament twice and in one of those occasions, he did not make the top-25. Hence, the statement "Brian Watts was not in the top 25 at the Masters Tournament one time" is supported by the table.
118	Supported. According to the table, viral families that have a replication site in the nucleus are Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae. This means that there are five viral families with a replication site in the nucleus, supporting the statement that "9 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus".
119	Supported. According to the table, 14 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and the unassigned group with spherical virion shape). Therefore, the statement "14 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm" is supported by the table.
120	Supported. According to the table, two viral families, herpesviridae and poxviridae, have a complex virion shape. Therefore, the statement "two viral families have a complex virion shape" is supported by the table.
121	Supported. According to the table, 13 viral families (Adenoviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae, astroviridae, caliciviridae, picornaviridae, flaviviridae, togaviridae, hepeviridae, orthomyxoviridae, and bunyaviridae) have an icosahedral virion shape, therefore the statement "thirteen viral families have an icosahedral virion shape" is supported by the table.
122	Supported. According to the table, seven viral families--Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and the Arenaviridae--have a helical virion shape. Therefore, the statement "seven viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table.
123	Supported. According to the "Replication site" column of the table, the viral families that replicate in the nucleus are Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, and Retroviridae. That makes a total of six viral families that replicate in the nucleus. Therefore, the statement "nine of the viral diseases replicate in the nucleus" is false.
124	Supported. According to row 23 of the table, the only viral disease with a spherical virion shape is one from the unassigned group, as all other viral diseases listed have either an icosahedral, helical, or bullet-shaped virion shape.
125	Supported. According to the "envelopment" column in the table, there are 8 viral diseases listed as "non-enveloped", which means they are not surrounded by a lipid membrane or envelope. Therefore, the statement "eight of the viral diseases are non-enveloped" is supported by the table.
126	Refuted. According to the table, there is more than one viral disease that belongs to the Baltimore group III. Row 24 shows the viral family Reoviridae, which belongs to Group III. Therefore, the statement "only one of the viral diseases is in Baltimore group III" is not true.
127	Supported. According to row 23 of the table, there is an unassigned viral disease that has an envelopment of spherical shape and replication site on the nucleus. Therefore, only one of the viral diseases in the table has not been assigned to a family.
128	Supported. According to the "replication site" column in the table, nine viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm, which are Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae. Therefore, the statement "9 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm" is supported by the table.
129	Refuted. According to the table, only 3 viral families, namely herpesviridae, adenoviridae, and hepadnaviridae, have a replication site in the nucleus (as denoted by "nucleus" under replication site in their respective rows). Therefore, the statement that 14 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus is incorrect.
130	Supported. According to the table, five viral families have a helical virion shape: coronaviridae, orthomyxoviridae, arenaviridae, bunyaviridae, and filoviridae. Therefore, the statement "two viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table, but it is an underestimate and is only partially correct.
131	Supported. According to the table, 6 viral families have an icosahedral virion shape, and 13 viral families have a helical virion shape. Therefore, the statement that "thirteen viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table.
132	Supported. According to the table, there are seven viral families (out of a total of 24) that have a icosahedral virion shape. The families are: adenoviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae, caliciviridae, and picornaviridae. Therefore, the statement "seven viral families have a icosahedral virion shape" is supported by the table.
133	Supported. According to the "replication site" column in the table, the viral families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Reoviridae all have a replication site in the cytoplasm and not inside the nucleus. Since there are 13 viral families that replicate in the cytoplasm out of the total of 23 viral families in the table, the statement that nine of the viral diseases replicate outside the nucleus is supported.
134	Refuted. According to row 23 of the table, there is an unassigned viral family that has an enveloped spherical virion shape. Therefore, the statement "none of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape" is incorrect.
135	Supported. According to the table, 12 out of the 24 viral diseases listed possess an enveloped virion shape (marked as "enveloped" in the table). Therefore, the statement "eight of the viral diseases possess an enveloped" is supported by the table.
136	Refuted. None of the viral diseases listed in the table are in Baltimore group III. All of the viral families are either in group I, II, IV, V, VI, or VII, as indicated in the table.
137	Refuted. Every viral disease listed in the table has been assigned to a family, as shown in the first column of the table. Therefore, the statement "only one of the viral diseases has been assigned to a family" is refuted by the table.
138	Refuted. According to the table, Galina Voskoboeva played only 2 games on a hard tennis court. The Tipton tournament she participated in was played on hard (i) surface, but it was not specified for the other tournaments that they were played on a hard surface.
139	Refuted. There are only five matches listed in the table, and only one of them (Row 4) was played on a clay surface, meaning galina voskoboeva has only played 20% of her matches on clay, not "galina voskoboeva played 20% of her games on a clay top tennis court". The table does not provide information about the number of games played by Galina Voskoboeva on clay or any other surface beyond the five matches listed.
140	Refuted. The table only shows a few matches and does not provide sufficient information to determine overall win rates for different court surfaces. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether Galina Voskoboeva has an equal win-rate between clay and hard courts or not based on this table.
141	Refuted. According to the table, Galina Voskoboeva played against Roberta Vinci in the Latina tournament on October 3, 2003, and lost. Therefore, she did play the same opponent (Roberta Vinci) more than one time. Hence, the statement that she never played the same opponent more than one time is incorrect.
142	Not supported. The table provides information on the outcomes, dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores of Galina Voskoboeva's matches, but it does not give any information on the average number of points she loses per match. Therefore, the statement that she loses with only four points on average cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
143	Refuted. Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 2 games on a hard tennis court (Tipton in 2003 and Pittsburgh in 2005) and 2 games on clay (Latina in 2003 and Cuneo in 2006). Therefore, the statement that she played 3 games on a hard tennis court and 1 on clay is not correct as she played an equal number of matches on both surfaces.
144	Refuted. The table only provides information for five matches played by Galina Voskoboeva and does not contain enough data to accurately calculate what percentage of her games were played on each surface. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is true or false based on the given table.
145	None
146	Unsupported. The table only includes five matches played by Galina Voskoboeva, out of which she played the same opponent, Alice Canepa, twice on June 6, 2006, in Cuneo, Italy. Since she played the same opponent twice, the statement "Galina Voskoboeva never played the same opponent more than one time except in 6 June 2006" is not supported by the table.
147	Refuted. The table provides the scores for only two matches where Galina Voskoboeva faced Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa, respectively. Therefore, we cannot calculate the average points lost in all of her matches against these opponents. Moreover, even in the matches mentioned in the table, the point difference was not provided. Thus, we cannot support or refute this statement based on the given table.
148	Supported. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 out of the 25 races of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, as indicated in the "race leader" column. Therefore, the statement "Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia" is supported by the table.
149	Refuted. According to the table, Alfredo Binda won five races during the 1933 Giro d'Italia (rows 3, 11, 13, 14, and 18), not six. However, he was the race leader for 17 of the 25 races (rows 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 28), not 13. Therefore, the statement that Alfredo Binda won 6 races and was the race leader for 13 races is not supported by the table.
150	Supported. According to row 22 of the table, Gerard Loncke (BEL) won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano in the 1933 Giro d'Italia on May 26th, while Alfredo Binda (ITA) was still the race leader. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
151	Supported. According to row 20 and 21 of the table, Ettore Meini won two consecutive stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia on May 24th and 25th respectively. Therefore, the statement "Ettore Meini won two races in a row, on May 24th and 25th during the 1933 Giro d'Italia" is supported by the table.
152	Refuted. According to the table, Learco Guerra was the winner of the first race of the 1933 Giro d'Italia and became the race leader. However, he also won the third stage (Genoa to Pisa) and became the race leader again on that stage. Therefore, the statement that he did not become race leader again for the rest of the circuit is incorrect.
153	Supported. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 races of the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
154	Refuted. According to the table, Alfredo Binda won 5 stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia (not 7 as stated), but he was the race leader for a total of 18 stages (not 15). Therefore, the statement "Alfredo Binda won seven races of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, but he was the race leader for 15 races" is not supported by the table.
155	Refuted. According to row 22 of the table, Gerard Loncke won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano on May 26th, but Alfredo Binda remained the race leader. Therefore, the statement that Gerad Loncke won the race on May 25th, despite Alfredo Binda being the race leader, is incorrect.
156	Supported. According to rows 20 to 22 of the table, Ettore Meini won three consecutive races on May 24th, 25th, and 26th during the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
157	Refuted. According to the table, Learco Guerra was the race leader for the first race of the 1933 Giro d'Italia but he lost the lead to Alfredo Binda after the second race. Alfredo Binda held the lead for the next nine races of the circuit. Therefore, the statement "Learco Guerra was the race leader for the first race of the 1933 Giro d'Italia and became the race leader again for the rest of the circuit" is incorrect.
158	Supported. According to the table, two players were indeed picked in the second round - Ray Donaldson at pick #4 (overall pick #32) and Tim Foley at pick #23 (overall pick #51).
159	Supported. According to the table, Wes Roberts was selected as the 170th overall pick in the 7th round, while Ed Whitley was selected as the 280th overall pick in the 11th round. Therefore, Wes Roberts was picked before Ed Whitley by the Indianapolis Colts.
160	Supported. According to the table, two players were drafted from USC (University of Southern California) - Ray Butler and Chris Foote, while only one player was drafted from Clemson - Marvin Sims. Therefore, the statement that more players were drafted from USC than from Clemson is supported by the table.
161	Unsupported. The given table only shows the draft history of the Indianapolis Colts until the 12th round, and it does not contain any information after that. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not players in the running back position were picked after the 10th round based on this table.
162	Supported. According to the table, Curtis Dickey was picked in the first round with the fifth overall pick, whereas Randy Bielski was picked in the twelfth round with the 311th overall pick, which is much later than when Dickey was selected. Therefore, the statement "Curtis Dickey was picked during an earlier round than Randy Bielski" is true and supported by the table.
163	Supported. According to the table, five players were picked in the second round of the draft - Ray Donaldson, Tim Foley, Ray Butler, Chris Foote, and Wes Roberts. Therefore, the statement that "5 players were picked in the 2nd rounds of the draft" is supported by the table.
164	Refuted. According to the table, neither Wes Roberts nor Ed Whitley were drafted in the 3rd round. Wes Roberts was drafted in the 7th round and Ed Whitley was drafted in the 11th round. Therefore, the statement that they were both picked in the 3rd round is incorrect.
165	Refuted. According to the table, USC and Clemson each had only one player drafted, so the statement that they had the most players drafted at three each is incorrect.
166	Refuted. According to the table, there were only two running back positions picked by the Indianapolis Colts in the draft history: Curtis Dickey picked at #5 in the 1st round, and Mark Bright picked at #227 in the 9th round. Therefore, the statement "there were 3 running back positions picked by the 6th round" is incorrect.
167	Refuted. According to the table, Curtis Dickey was picked in Round 1 with the fifth overall pick and Randy Bielski was picked in Round 12 with the 311th overall pick. Randy Bielski was not picked in Round 2, and therefore, the statement that Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski were picked in Round 2 is incorrect.
168	Refuted. According to the table, Italy received two gold medals more than Canada with a total of 2 golds, 1 silver, and 2 bronzes, ranking 10th while Canada had 0 golds, 2 silvers, and 3 bronzes, ranking 13th. However, while Italy tied with the United States and West Germany in terms of gold medals won, it did not tie with them in terms of overall medal count or rank.
169	Supported. According to the table, Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze) and Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze). Therefore, Sweden placed higher than Austria in the total medal count for the 1988 Winter Olympics.
170	Refuted. According to the table, five different countries (Finland, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, and Italy) received bronze medals, and each country received a different number of bronze medals. Therefore, the statement that six different countries received the same number of bronze medals is incorrect.
171	Refuted. According to the table, there were several countries that did not receive gold medals, including Sweden and Canada. However, every country listed in the table received at least one medal in one of the categories: gold, silver, or bronze. Therefore, the statement that Sweden and Canada were the only countries on the table that did not receive a medal in one of the categories is incorrect.
172	Supported. According to the table, the Soviet Union won a total of 29 medals, while East Germany won a total of 25. Therefore, the Soviet Union received four more medals than East Germany in the total medal count.
173	Refuted. According to the table, Italy won two gold medals, while Canada, the United States, and West Germany won 2, 2, and 2 gold medals, respectively. Therefore, the statement "Italy received three more gold medals than Canada did but tied with the United States and West Germany" is incorrect since Italy did not receive more gold medals than any of these three countries.
174	Refuted. According to the table, Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze) and Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze). Therefore, Austria placed higher in the total medal count as compared to Sweden, and the statement that Sweden placed lower than Austria is true.
175	None
176	Refuted. According to the table, Sweden did not receive a medal in only one of the categories (silver in row 6) while Canada did not receive a medal in only one of the categories (gold in row 12). Therefore, the statement that "Sweden and Canada were the only countries on the table that did not receive a medal in two of the categories" is incorrect.
177	Refuted. According to the table, the Soviet Union won a total of 29 medals (11 gold, 9 silver, and 9 bronze), while East Germany won a total of 25 medals (9 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, the Soviet Union received 4 more medals than East Germany, not six as stated in the statement.
178	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, NGC 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9, and according to row 18, NGC 1705 has the second-largest apparent magnitude of 12.8. Therefore, the statement "NGC 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 followed by NGC 1705 with 12.8" is supported by the table.
179	Supported. According to row 18 of the table, NGC 1705 has a redshift of 633 ± 6 kilometers per second, which is the smallest redshift of all the objects listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "NGC 1705 has the smallest redshift at 633 kilometers per second plus or minus 6 kilometers per second" is supported by the table.
180	Refuted. There is no direct comparison between the redshifts of NGC 2082 and NGC 1705 in the table, so the statement cannot be supported or refuted using the given data.
181	Refuted. According to the given table, NGC 1574 has a declination of °58′29″, but there is no information on the declination of any other galaxy in the Dorado Group. Therefore, it cannot be determined if it has a deeper declination than any other galaxy in the group.
182	Supported. According to the table, the lowest right ascension (RA) is indeed NGC 1533, with an RA of 4 hours 9 minutes and 51.8 seconds.
183	Refuted. According to the table, NGC 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9, not NGC 1515. NGC 1515 has an apparent magnitude of 12.1, and NGC 1705 has an apparent magnitude of 12.8. Therefore, the statement "NGC 1515 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 followed by NGC 1705 with 12.8" is incorrect.
184	Refuted. According to the table, NGC 1705 has the smallest redshift of 633 km/s +/- 6 km/s among all the galaxies listed. Therefore, the statement that NGC 1796 has the largest redshift at 633 kilometers per second plus or minus 6 kilometers per second is incorrect.
185	Supported. According to the table, NGC 1705 has a redshift of 633 km/s, while NGC 2082 has a redshift of 1184 km/s. Therefore, NGC 1705 has a redshift faster than NGC 2082 by 551 km/s (1184 - 633 km/s). The provided statement stated that it was faster by 441 km/s, which falls within the stated margin of error of 6 km/s; hence the statement is supported.
186	Refuted. There is no information given in the table about the declination of NGC 2082 or any comparison of its declination with the declinations of other galaxies in the Dorado Group. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that NGC 2082 has a deeper declination than any other galaxy in the Dorado Group based on this table.
187	Refuted. There is no record of NGC 2082 in the table provided. Therefore, the statement about its right ascension is incorrect. Additionally, none of the objects in the table have a right ascension of 4 hours 8 minutes and 58.1 seconds. The lowest right ascension listed is 4 hours 4 minutes and 2.7 seconds for NGC 1515.
188	Supported. According to the table, the earliest date listed is September 4, 2007, and it took place in Cedar Rapids for a men's golf match between Iowa and Iowa State. Therefore, the statement "Cedar Rapids is the site with the earliest date" is supported by the table.

198	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography was won by Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long who was nominated for Outstanding Costume Design. Therefore, the statement "the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography did not go to William Ivey Long" is supported by the table.
199	The statement is partially correct. According to the table, William Ivey Long was indeed a nominee for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards for the musical "La Cage aux Folles".
200	Unclear. According to the table, Jerry Mitchell won a Tony Award for Best Choreography for La Cage aux Folles in 2005. However, the statement "Jerry Mitchell is one of two winners of a Tony Award" does not provide enough information for me to determine if it is supported or refuted by the table.
201	Refuted. According to the table, Jerry Mitchell received two nominations for the Drama Desk Award, and he won in both categories: Outstanding Choreography and Outstanding Revival of a Musical. Therefore, the statement that he is one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award is incorrect.
202	Refuted. Gary Beach is listed as a nominee in one category of the Tony Awards in the table, which is "Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical". However, the statement suggests that he was nominated for a Tony Award in general, which is not accurate. So, the statement that "Gary Beach is one of four nominees for a Tony Award" is refuted.
203	Refuted. According to row 8 of the table, William Ivey Long was nominated for the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design, not for Outstanding Choreography. Jerry Mitchell won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography that year. Therefore, the statement "William Ivey Long won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography" is incorrect.
204	Refuted. According to the table, the nominee for best costume design in 2005 was William Ivey Long, but he only received a nomination and did not win the award. Jerry Mitchell won the award for best choreography, and William Ivey Long was a nominee for best costume design but did not win. Therefore, the statement "the 2005 nominee for best costume design won the award" is not supported by the table.
205	Refuted. According to the table, while Jerry Mitchell was nominated for Best Choreography and won the Tony Award in that category, he was not nominated for any other Tony Awards that year, nor did he win any other awards for his work on La Cage aux Folles in the given award ceremonies. Therefore, the statement "Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards" is refuted.
206	Refuted. According to the table, Jerry Mitchell was only nominated for a Drama Desk Award twice - in the categories of "Outstanding Choreography" and "Outstanding Costume Design" for his work on "La Cage aux Folles" in 2005. Therefore, the statement that Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award three times is not supported by the table.
207	Refuted. Gary Beach was not listed as a winner of a Tony award in the table. He was only nominated for the Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical award in 2005. Therefore, the statement that "Gary Beach is one of four winners of a Tony award" is incorrect.
208	Refuted. The table does not mention Lleyton Hewitt winning the Master Series Finals in any year, so the statement that he won the tournament twice in 2002 and 2003 is incorrect.
209	Refuted. There are only 7 entries in the table, and none of them shows that Lleyton Hewitt played in 19 Master Series finals where a side finished with 6 points. Therefore, the statement "19 of Lleyton Hewitt Master Series finals had one side or the other finishing with 6 points" is refuted.
210	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, the championship in Paris had a "carpet (i)" surface, which means it was played on a carpet - indoor court. Therefore, the statement "only the master series final in Paris had a carpet surface" is supported by the table.
211	Supported. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up in five championships out of the total seven listed in the table. Specifically, he was a runner-up in Stuttgart in 2000, Cincinnati in 2002 and 2004, and Paris in 2002.
212	Unsupported. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt faced Tim Henman in the final of Indian Wells in 2002 and then he faced Gustavo Kuerten in the final of Indian Wells again in 2003.

213	Refuted. The table shows that Lleyton Hewitt won two different Masters Series events: Indian Wells in 2002 and Indian Wells again in 2003. he was also a runner-up in Cincinnati in 2002 and 2004, and in Paris in 2002. However, he did not win any Masters Series events in 2004 or 2005, according to the table. Therefore, the statement that Lleyton Hewitt won the Masters Series two times, in 2004 and 2005, is false.
214	Refuted. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt played in a total of seven Masters Series finals and out of those, he won three and was a runner-up in four. There is no pattern of "one side or the other finishing with 4 points" as different scores are shown for each match in the table. Therefore, the statement "19 of Lleyton Hewitt's Masters Series finals had one side or the other finishing with 4 points" is refuted by the table.
215	Refuted. According to the table, the Paris championship final in 2002 was played on a carpet surface, not just the master series final in Cincinnati. Therefore, the statement that only the master series final in Cincinnati had a carpet surface is not correct.
216	Refuted. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up in three tournaments out of a total of seven: Stuttgart in 2000, Cincinnati in 2002, and Cincinnati again in 2004. Therefore, the statement "Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up one time out of a total of seven" is not correct.
217	Refuted. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt only faced Wayne Ferreira in one final which was the 2000 Stuttgart open, and it was not a Masters Series event. Therefore, the statement that he faced the same opponent, Wayne Ferreira, in every Masters Series final is not supported by the table.

According to rows 9 and 10 of the table, Netherlands played a game on June 1, 1998, against Paraguay, winning 5-1, and Romania played a game on June 3, 1998, against Paraguay, winning 3-2. Therefore, the statement "Netherlands and Romania had games on June 1 and June 3, respectively, in 1998" is supported by the table.
221	Supported. According to rows 12 and 13 of the table, both of Paraguay's first two games in the 1998 World Cup ended in a 0-0 draw, meaning that neither team scored during those matches. Therefore, the statement that neither team scored for the first two games of the World Cup in France is supported by the table.
222	Incorrect. According to the table, there was no game played on June 18, 1998. The games played on June 12, 19, and 28 had scores of 0-0, 0-0, and 0-0 (1-0 aet) respectively. Therefore, the statement that the games played on June 18 and 28 had a score of 1-1 is incorrect.
223	Supported. According to rows 8 and 9 of the table, the Kirin Cup had games on both June 1 and June 3, 1998. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.

Similarly, according to row 9 of the table, the Netherlands played a friendly match on June 1, 1998, at the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven, which is not relevant to the statement. However, according to row 15 of the table, the Netherlands played a World Cup match on June 28, 1998, at the Stade Félix Bollaert in Lens, France. Therefore, the statement "Netherlands and Romania had games on June 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998" is supported by the table.
226	Refuted. According to the table, there were several games played before the World Cup matches involving Paraguay, and at least one of those games (row 2) ended with Paraguay scoring four goals. Furthermore, there were three World Cup matches played by Paraguay (rows 12-14), and two of them resulted in a goalless draw. Therefore, the statement "neither team scored for only the first game of the World Cup in France" is incorrect.
227	Refuted. According to the table, there were no games on June 18 listed. The score for the game on June 28 was 0-0 in regular time and 1-0 after extra time. Therefore, the statement "the games on June 18 and 28, both had a score of 2-0" is not supported by the table.

Therefore, the statement that "Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth were all captains that won the cup two times" is supported by the table.
231	Supported. According to the table, the Solheim Cup was hosted outside of the United States six times from 1990-2013: in Scotland in 1992 and 2000, in Wales in 1996, in Sweden in 2003, in Ireland in 2011, and in Colorado in 2013.
232	Supported. According to the table, the highest score for a winning team was 18 points, which Europe achieved in the 2013 Solheim Cup, while the lowest was 11.5 points, which Europe won in 1992.

Therefore, the statement "the US last won the Solheim Cup in 2009, which was one of seven titles since 1990" is not correct as it does not consider the US win in 2015 and the total number of titles won by the US team.
235	Refuted. According to the table, Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin were captains that won the Solheim Cup more than once. Patty Sheehan won in 2002 and 2009, while Judy Rankin won in 1996 and 1998. However, Kathy Whitworth is not an example that supports the statement because, according to the table, she was the U.S. captain in 1990 and lost to Europe.

239	Refuted. According to the table, the attendance was less than 20,000 people on August 4th (15,230) and on August 5th (16,428), so there were two occasions when attendance was below 20,000 people. However, the statement "only two times was the attendance less than 20000 people and it was on August 4 and August 5" indicates that there were no other instances of attendance being less than 20,000 people for the entire season, which is not supported by the table as there could have been other games where attendance was less than 20,000 people.
240	Supported. According to rows 25 and 26 of the table, the attendance on August 26th and August 27th was 48063 and 48032 respectively. Therefore, the statement "the attendance on August 26 and August 27 was 48063 and 48032" is supported by the table.

244	Refuted. According to the table, the attendance was less than 20,000 only once during the period mentioned (August 4th - August 6th), on August 5th against the Philadelphia Phillies. Therefore, the statement that the attendance was less than 20,000 over five times between August 4th and 6th is incorrect.
245	Refuted. The attendance listed for August 26th is incorrect, as there is no entry for August 26th in the table. Additionally, the attendance listed for August 27th is incorrect, as the actual attendance listed in the table for that game against the Reds was 48032.

256	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for week 6 was 71,009 and the attendance for week 13 was 43,475. Meanwhile, the attendance for week 12 was 66,875.

289	Supported. According to the table, all of the entries in the fifth column (Class) are "d", which indicates that all of the translators are Class D. Therefore, the statement "all of the translators are class d" is supported by the table.
290	Supported. Each call sign for the translators listed in the table starts with the letter "w" followed by a three-digit number that begins with "2". Therefore, all of the call signs for the translators listed in this table include three-digit numbers that begin with the number 2.
291	Supported. According to the table, W293AL has an ERP of 80 watts, which is the highest among all the frequencies listed. On the other hand, W264BF has the lowest ERP of only 2 watts, making it the one with the lowest power. Therefore, the statement "W293AL has the highest ERP w, whereas W264BF has the lowest ERP w" is supported by the table.
292	Supported. According to the table, Illinois and Indiana each have three translators. There are three translators listed for Illinois in rows 1, 2, and 5, and three translators listed for Indiana in rows 3, 6, and 7. Therefore, the statement "Illinois and Indiana each have 3 translators" is supported by the table.
293	Refuted. There is no evidence in the table to support the statement that "there is a 5 MHz frequency change range." The frequencies listed in the table range from 92.1 MHz to 106.5 MHz, with various intensities of effective radiated power and classes of service. However, there is no information to suggest that there is a range of 5 MHz over which the frequencies are distributed.
294	Supported. According to the table, all of the entries for the WHLP translators (W221BY, W264BF, W240BJ, W276BM, W293AL, and W223AU) are Class D. Therefore, the statement that "the translators are Class D and C" is partially correct as all translators listed are Class D only, not Class C.
295	Refuted. According to the table, the ERP (Effective Radiated Power) W varies for each call sign listed. The ERPs listed in the table are 38, 2, 10, 19, and 80. Therefore, the statement that "the number 2 is the only ERP W" is incorrect because other ERP W values are listed in the table.
296	Refuted. According to row 3 and 6 of the table, w264bf has an erp of 2 while w293al has an erp of 80. Therefore, w293al and w264bf have different erp, and the statement that they share the same erp is incorrect.
297	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one translator listed in the city of Englewood, Illinois, which is w264bf. Therefore, the statement "Englewood, Illinois has two translators" is refuted by the table.
298	Refuted. According to the table, the Australian Open and the French Open did not have the same results in 1996 and 1990.

299	Refuted. According to the table, Katrina Adams' result in the US Open was different in 1986 and 1999. She played only in the first round in 1986 and lost in the first round, while in 1999 she played until the second round and lost. Hence, the statement "the US Open had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999" is not supported by the table.
300	Refuted. According to row 5 of the table, Katrina Adams had "a" as a result in the Australian Open in 1986, and in the US Open in 1986. Wimbledon appears multiple times in the table, and in various years (1986-1999), Adams had the following results at Wimbledon: "a" in 1986, semi-finals in 1988, quarter-finals in 1989, 3rd round in 1990, quarter-finals in 1991, 3rd round in 1992, 1st round in 1993, 2nd round in 1994, 3rd round in 1995, quarter-finals in 1996, 3rd round in 1997, 3rd round in 1998, and 1st round in 1999. Therefore, the statement "Wimbledon had only one a result during the years 1986 to 1999" is not supported by the table.
301	Refuted. According to the table, different tournaments had different results in the years 1990 and 1999. For example, in the Australian Open, Katrina Adams reached the third round in 1990 while she only reached the first round in 1999. Similarly, in Wimbledon, she reached the quarterfinals in 1990 while she reached only the first round in 1999. Hence, the statement is not supported, and rather it is refuted.
302	Supported. According to the table, the Australian Open had three instances where Katrina Adams got an "A" result, meaning she did not compete in that tournament. On the other hand, Wimbledon had only one instance of an "A" result, which means that she did not compete in that year's Wimbledon tournament. Therefore, the statement "the Australian Open had three 'A' results and Wimbledon had only one" is supported by the table.
303	Supported. According to row 3 and row 4 of the table, the results for the Australian Open and French Open were different in 1996. In the Australian Open, Katrina Adams did not compete (indicated by "a"), while in the French Open she reached the quarterfinals ("qf").
304	Supported. According to the table, Katrina Adams achieved a result of 1r (first round) in the US Open in 1986, and a result of 3r (third round) in the US Open in 1999. Therefore, the statement "the US Open had 1r in 1986 but had 3r in 1999" is supported by the table.
305	Refuted. According to the table, Katrina Adams reached the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1988 and  got knocked out in the first round in 1999. Therefore, the statement that Wimbledon had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999 is not supported by the table.

Therefore, the statement that "the Australian Open had the same results as Wimbledon had" is incorrect.
308	Partially supported. According to the table, round 10 of the 1962 VFL season took place on June 23, 1962, and all the matches listed in the table were played on that day.

329	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one athlete who achieved a mark greater than 29 feet, which is Mike Powell with a mark of 8.95 m (29ft4¼in). Therefore, the statement that "only four of the athletes had a mark greater than 29 feet" is not correct.
330	Supported. According to the table, Bob Beamon set his record of 8.90 meters (29ft2¼in) on October 18, 1968, in Mexico City, which is the earliest date in the table. Therefore, he is the athlete who set his long jump record the longest time ago.
331	Refuted. According to the table, the record of 8.95 m was set by Mike Powell on August 30, 1991, which is more recent than Dwight Phillips's record of 8.74 m set on June 7, 2009. Therefore, the statement "the most recent long jump record was set by Dwight Phillips" is incorrect.

337	Refuted. According to the table, Keith Miller (Australia) took 13 wickets, and Ernie Toshack (Australia) took 11 wickets. Both players appeared in different numbers of matches (Miller played in all 5 matches, while Toshack played in only 4 matches).

338	Supported. According to the table, both Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes series, but Ray Lindwall had a better bowling average of 19.62 compared to Bill Johnston's 23.33.

343	Refuted. According to the table, Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston both took the same number of wickets with 27 each. However, Lindwall had a better bowling average of 19.62 compared to Johnston's average of 23.33. Therefore, the statement that Ray Lindwall had a worse bowling average despite taking a higher number of wickets compared to Bill Johnston is incorrect.
344	Refuted. According to the table, only Norman Yardley and Jim Laker (England players) took fewer wickets than Bill Johnston (Australian player). Therefore, the statement "all of the England players took as many wickets as Bill Johnston" is not supported by the table.

352	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, David Cowling played 39 games and made one substitute appearance in the league, while Peter Fletcher played 30 games and made 8 substitute appearances in the league, which add up to a total of 38 league appearances. None of the players have even close to the "highest league apps" of Chris Topping and Dave Sutton.

354	Refuted. According to the table, Ian Robins has the highest number of total goals with 27, while Chris Topping has 0 total goals. Therefore, the statement "there are two players with the highest number of total goals Ian Robins and Chris Topping" is refuted by the table.
355	Refuted. According to the table, only Peter Hart has scored a goal in the FA Cup during the 1979-80 season, and none of the other players have scored in the FA Cup. Therefore, the statement that "two other players apart from Peter Hart have FA Cup goals" is not supported by the table.
356	Refuted. The statement is incorrect as all the attendance figures in the table are greater than 5000. In fact, the lowest attendance figure listed in the table is 20,809, which is greater than 5000. Hence, we can conclude that the team played in all 28 games with an attendance greater than 5000 in May of the 1991 season.

358	Supported. According to rows 27 and 28 of the table, the Toronto Blue Jays won their last two games in May 1991 (against the Athletics and the Angels, respectively) out of the three games they played in May.

Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
361	Refuted. According to the table, there are no games in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season that had an attendance lower than 5000.

376	Partially supported. According to the table, Ben Curtis, J.B. Holmes, Steve Flesch, and David Toms all participated in the 2008 PGA Championship and finished with scores of -2, -1, +3, and +3, respectively. Ben Curtis and J.B. Holmes are from the United States, but Steve Flesch is also from the United States, while David Toms is also from the United States. Hence, three of the four players listed are from the United States, which partially supports the statement.
377	Supported. According to the table, Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, and Charlie Wi is from South Korea. Therefore, the statement "Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, and Charlie Wi is from South Korea" is supported by the table.

385	Refuted. The statement is incorrect on two accounts. Firstly, Camilo Villegas and David Toms did not tie for eighth place, but rather tied for ninth place with a score of +3 to par. Secondly, Camilo Villegas's score in row 13 of the table is written incorrectly as "74 + 72 = 67", which does not make mathematical sense, and is presumably a typographical error.
386	Supported. According to row 3 and row 6 of the table, the "VCRt" has a 7.62 mm FN Mag 60-20 machine gun as its weapon and has a maximum speed of 75km/h (47mph). The "VCTP" has a 20mm (79in) RH - 202 autocannon as its weapon, but its maximum speed is also 75km/h (47mph). Therefore, the statement that the VCTP 20mm (79in) RH - 202 autocannon does not have 75km/h (47mph) as the VCRt is supported by the table.
387	Refuted. According to the table, the VCA 40t (44.1 tons) has no VCTM listed, and the 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer has no VCTM listed either. Similarly, the VCA 40t (44.1 tons) has no VCTM listed, and the 120 mm (4.72in) mortar has a VCTM of 25t (27.6 tons), not 26t (28.7 tons) as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement "VCA 40t (44.1 tons) and 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer have a VCTM of 26t (28.7 tons) and 120 mm (4.72in) mortar respectively" is refuted by the table.
388	Refuted. The VCTP with 24hp/t and VCA 155 with 18hp/t are mentioned in the table, but there is no mention of their speed. The speed of 55 km/h belongs to the VCA 155, but it is not related to the comparison in the statement. Therefore, there is no information in the table to either support or refute the statement about speed.
389	Refuted. The table indicates that both VCLC and VCRT have the same weight of 32t (35.3 tons) in row 2. However, row 3 shows that VCLC has 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets as its armament, while VCRT has a 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN Mag 60-20 machine gun. Therefore, the statement is incorrect as VCLC has different armament than VCRT.
390	Supported. According to row 1 and row 3 of the table, the VCPC and VCRT for the 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun are the same for both VCTP 20 mm (79in) RH-202 autocannon and VCRT. Similarly, row 1 and row 6 of the table show that the VCPC and VCRT of 75km/h (47 mph) are identical for both VCTP and VCRT. Therefore, the statement "the VCPC and VCRT of 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun are the same for VCTP 20 mm (79in) RH-202 autocannon, and so is the VCPC and VCRT of 75 km/h (47 mph) for VCTP 75 km/h (47 mph)" is supported by the table.
391	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, the VCRT has a 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun, but the VCVP 20 mm (79in) RH-202 autocannon does not have this machine gun listed on the table. Therefore, the statement that "the VCTP 20 mm (79in) RH-202 autocannon does not have 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun as the VCRT" is supported by the table.
392	Refuted. According to row 2, VCA 155 weighs 40 tons and has a VCTM of 18hp/t (16.5hp/ton). Whereas, VCTM has a weight of 26t (28.7tons) and a VCTM of 28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton). Also, according to row 3, the 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 Howitzer is not paired with the VCTM, but with the VCA 155. Therefore, the statement "VCA 40t (44.1tons) and 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer have a VCTM of 28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton) and 120 mm (4.72in) mortar respectively" is refuted by the table.
393	Refuted. The statement appears to combine information from different rows of the table. According to row 1, VCTP has 24hp/t (23hp/ton), which is indeed correct. However, row 2 shows that VCA 155 has a weight of 40t (44.1tons) and row 6 shows its maximum speed is 55 km/h (34 mph). Therefore, the information about the VCA 155's weight and speed is not related to the statement about VCTP and is incorrect. Furthermore, row 3 specifies that the VCA 155 has a 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer, which is not in conflict with the statement.
394	Refuted. According to row 5 of the table, both VCLC and VCPC have a VCRT of 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun, so the second part of the statement is incorrect. Additionally, the statement does not provide enough information to determine whether VCLC and VCPC have the same weight.
395	Refuted. The table shows that the VCPC and VCRT of the 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun for the VCA 155 and VCLC are the same, but it does not indicate that they are the same for the VCRT 20mm RH-202 autocannon. Similarly, the VCPC and VCRT speed for the VCTP is 75 km/h, but this information does not apply to the VCPC and VCRT of the VCTM. Therefore, the statement that "the VCPC and VCTP of 7.62mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun are the same for VCRT 20 mm (79in) RH - 202 autocannon, and so is the VCPC and VCRT of 75 km/h (47 mph) for VCTP 75 km/h (47 mph)" is not supported by the table.
396	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" was directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond. Therefore, the statement "in the episode Ballrooms and Biscotti in the show Gilmore Girls, the director was not Matthew Diamond" is supported by the table.
397	Refuted. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino was not the director of any of the episodes in 2003. Therefore, the statement "Amy Sherman-Palladino was the director of four episodes in 2003" is not supported by the table.
398	Refuted. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino directed 4 episodes (including the first episode) while Daniel Palladino directed 3 episodes. Therefore, the statement that Daniel Palladino directed one more episode than Amy Sherman-Palladino did is incorrect.
399	Refuted. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino both served as writers for some episodes, but they did not co-direct any of the episodes listed. Therefore, the statement "Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino directed two episodes together" is not supported by the table.
400	Refuted. Episode 69 titled Chicken or Beef had 5.5 million viewers, while episode 67 titled The Lorelais' First Day at Yale had 3.9 million viewers. Therefore, the statement "number 67 titled The Lorelais' First Day at Yale had 1.6 million fewer viewers than episode 69 titled Chicken or Beef?" is incorrect. The difference in viewership between these two episodes is actually 1.6 million more viewers for episode 69.
401	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, the writer for the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" was Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
402	Refuted. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino was the director of the first episode (Ballrooms and Biscotti) and not a single episode, therefore the statement that she only directed a single episode in 2003 is incorrect.
403	Refuted. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino directed 4 episodes, and Daniel Palladino directed 5 episodes. Therefore, Daniel Palladino directed one episode more than Amy Sherman-Palladino did, and the statement "Daniel Palladino directed three episodes fewer than Amy Sherman-Palladino did" is incorrect.
404	Refuted. While Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino both served as writers for several episodes of Gilmore Girls, according to the table, they only worked together as director/writer for three episodes: "Ballrooms and Biscotti", "An Affair to Remember", and "Luke Can See Her Face". Therefore, the statement that they directed more than three episodes together is not supported by the table.
405	Refuted. According to the table, episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef" had 5.5 million US viewers while episode 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 3.9 million US viewers. Therefore, the statement that "number 67 titled The Lorelais' First Day at Yale had more viewers than episode 69 titled Chicken or Beef" is not correct.
406	Supported. According to the table, call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, whereas call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama. Therefore, the statement that "call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, while the call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama" is supported by the table.
407	Supported. According to row 3 and row 4 of the table, the frequency for call sign w269ax is 101.7 FM and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 102.5 FM, respectively. Therefore, the statement "the frequency MHz for call sign w269ax and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 101.7 FM and 102.5 FM, respectively" is supported by the table.
408	Supported. According to the table, the city of license for W282AE is Macon, Georgia, and the city of license for W290AG is Griffin, Georgia. Hence, the statement is correct.
409	None

Therefore, the statement "the ERP W and class for W290AG and W282AE is 27 and D for both, but one has a city of license of Macon, Georgia and the other has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia" is supported by the table.
411	Refuted. According to the table, call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, not Anniston, Alabama. Similarly, call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama, not Griffin, Georgia. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.
412	Refuted. According to the table, the frequency for call sign w269ax is 101.7 fm and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 102.5 fm. Therefore, the statement that "the frequency mhz for call sign w269ax and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 93.9 fm and 105.9 fm, respectively" is incorrect.
413	Refuted. According to the table, the city of license for W282AE is Macon, Georgia and the city of license for W290AG is Griffin, Georgia. Therefore, the statement that the city of license for W282AE is Albany, Georgia, and the city of license for W290AG is Gadsden, Alabama is incorrect.
414	Supported. According to the table, both W230AV and W290AG have an ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of 27 watts and a class D license. Therefore, the statement "the erp w and the class for W230AV in Gadsden, Alabama is the same erp w and class for W290AG in Griffin, Georgia" is supported by the table.
415	Refuted. According to the table, the erp w and class for W230AV is 10 watts and class D, and the city of license is Gadsden, Alabama. The erp w and class for W273AE is 55 watts and class D, and the city of license is Albany, Georgia. Therefore, the statement that "the erp w and class for W290AG and W230AV is 55 and D for both, but one has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama and the other has a city of license of Macon, Georgia" is incorrect.
416	Supported. According to row 17 and 21 of the table, Pakistan and Yemen have each won one bronze medal in Wushu at the Asian Games. Therefore, the statement that "both Pakistan and Yemen have won one bronze medal for wushu at the Asian Games" is supported by the table.
417	Refuted. According to the table, China has won 43 gold medals while Iran has won 4 gold medals in wushu at the Asian Games. Therefore, China has won 39 more gold medals than Iran.
418	Supported. According to the table, Singapore and Mongolia have not won any gold medals in wushu at the Asian Games. Therefore, the statement "neither Singapore nor Mongolia have won a gold medal for wushu at the Asian Games" is supported by the table.
419	Refuted. According to row 7 of the table, the Philippines have won only one gold medal in wushu, whereas Macau has won one gold medal. While they have both won five silver medals (row 7 for Philippines and row 9 for Macau), the Philippines have won 8 more bronze medals in wushu compared to Macau (14 bronze medals for the Philippines in row 7 and 4 bronze medals for Macau in row 8). Therefore, the statement "the Philippines and Macau have won the same number of gold and silver medals for wushu, but the Philippines have won 4 more bronze medals" is not supported by the table.
420	Refuted. According to the table, Hong Kong has won a total of 15 medals (2 gold, 9 silver, 4 bronze) in Wushu at the Asian Games, while Thailand has won a total of 11 medals (2 gold, 3 silver, 6 bronze).

421	Refuted. According to the table, Pakistan has won one bronze medal, and Yemen has won one bronze medal in wushu at the Asian Games. Therefore, the statement that Pakistan and Yemen have won three bronze medals for wushu at the Asian Games is incorrect.
422	Refuted. According to the table, China has won 43 gold medals in wushu at the Asian Games, while Iran has only won 4 gold medals. Therefore, China has won 39 more gold medals than Iran in wushu at the Asian Games, not 40 as stated in the statement.
423	Refuted. Singapore, Myanmar, and Mongolia have all won at least one gold medal in wushu at the Asian Games, according to the table.

Therefore, the statement "neither Singapore, Mongolia, nor Myanmar have won a gold medal for wushu at the Asian Games" is refuted by the table.
424	Refuted. According to the table, the Philippines has won one more gold medal than Macau (1 compared to Macau's 1), the same number of silver medals (5 each), and three fewer bronze medals (the Philippines has won 8 bronze medals, while Macau has won 4). Therefore, the statement that "The Philippines and Macau have won the same number of gold and silver medals for wushu, but Macau has won 4 more bronze medals" is not accurate.
425	Refuted. According to the table, Hong Kong has won 4 bronze medals (as stated in row 4), while Thailand has won 6 bronze medals (as stated in row 5). Therefore, the statement that Hong Kong has won 4 more bronze medals than Thailand is incorrect.

Therefore, the statement that Stuckey led the Pistons in points scored in two games during this period of the season is supported by the table.
427	Refuted. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons lost eight games during this period of their 2010-2011 season, from game 62 to game 73. So, the statement that the Pistons lost six games during this period is incorrect.
428	Refuted. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons did not win by over ten points in any of the games during this period of their 2010-2011 season. They won one game against the Toronto Raptors (game 68) by a margin of 14 points (107-93), but this is the closest they came to winning a game by more than ten points. Therefore, the statement "the Detroit Pistons won by over ten points in three games during this period of their 2010-2011 season" is refuted by the table.
429	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the game on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center had an attendance of 11,364, which was the lowest attendance recorded during the period of the 2010-2011 season covered by the table. Therefore, the statement "the Detroit Pistons had their lowest game attendance during this period of the 2010-2011 season on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center" is supported by the table.
430	Refuted. The table does not provide information on instances of a "tie" for most rebounds by Detroit Pistons players during this period of the 2010-2011 season. It only lists the highest rebounder(s) for each game. Therefore, the statement that there were four instances of a tie for most rebounds during this period is not supported by the table.
431	Refuted. According to the table, Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points in two games during this period of the 2010-2011 season: game 62 against Milwaukee with 25 points and game 64 against Washington with 9 rebounds.

433	Refuted. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons did not win any of their games during this period of the 2010-2011 season by more than ten points. They had one overtime win by a margin of 14 points (game 69, March 18, vs. New York), but that is the only game where they won with a double-digit margin.
434	Refuted. According to the table, the game on March 20th against Atlanta was played at the Philips Arena, and the attendance during that game was 17,580, which is not the lowest attendance during the given period.

435	Refuted. None of the rows in the table indicate that there were ties for most rebounds by Detroit Pistons players during this period of the 2010-11 season. Therefore, the statement is not supported by this table.
436	Supported. According to the table, episode 4 of Dexter (Season 3) had US viewership of 0.86 million while episode 2 had US viewership of 0.79 million. As the viewership of episode 4 is higher than that of episode 2, the statement "more viewers in the US watch episode 4 of Dexter (Season 3) than watched episode 2" is supported by the table.
437	Partially supported. According to the table, Keith Gordon directed one episode of Dexter in season 3, titled "Our Father." However, the table does not show any other episodes directed by Keith Gordon in season 3. Therefore, the statement that Keith Gordon directed two episodes of Dexter in season 3 is partially supported as he directed only one episode.
438	Supported. According to the table, Season 3 of Dexter started with the episode "Our Father" on September 28, 2008, and ended with the episode "I Had a Dream" on December 7, 2008.

439	False. According to the table, the TV series Dexter had 12 episodes in its third season, with episode numbers ranging from 25 to 36 (there is no episode 33 listed). Therefore, the statement "the TV series Dexter had 11 episodes in its third season" is incorrect.
440	Refuted. According to the table, Lauren Gussis is credited as the writer for the episode "Easy as Pie" directed by Steve Shill. Therefore, the statement "Lauren Gussis is not an episode director for Dexter" is refuted by the table.
441	Refuted. According to the table, the fourth episode of Dexter's third season ("All in the Family") had 0.86 million US viewers, while the second episode ("Finding Freebo") had only 0.79 million US viewers. Therefore, the statement that more viewers in the US watched the second episode of Dexter's third season than the fourth episode is incorrect.
442	Refuted. According to the table, only one episode of Dexter season 3 was written by Keith Gordon, titled "Our Father". Therefore, the statement "Keith Gordon wrote two episodes of Dexter in season 3" is not supported by the table.
443	Supported. According to the table, the first episode of Dexter Season 3 (titled "Our Father") aired on September 28, 2008, which is before October of 2008. Therefore, the statement that "season 3 of Dexter began airing after October of 2008" is false.
444	Refuted. According to the table, Dexter season 3 only had a total of 12 episodes (numbered 25 to 36), so the statement "the TV series Dexter had more than a dozen episodes in its third season" is incorrect.
445	Refuted. According to row 8 of the table, Lauren Gussis was a writer for an episode of Dexter titled "Easy as Pie." Therefore, the statement that "Lauren Gussis was not a writer for Dexter" is refuted by the table.
446	Supported. According to the table, the election results were counted five times in Bhind district (rows 2-6) and three times in Datia district (rows 7-9). Therefore, the statement "the results were counted in Bhind district five times and three times in Datia" is supported by the table.
447	Refuted. According to the table, Mehgaon had 210,649 electorates in 2009, which is not the highest number. The constituency with the highest number of electorates in 2009 is Bhind with 197,183 electorates. Therefore, the statement "Mehgaon had the highest number of electorates in 2009" is refuted by the table.
448	Supported. According to the table, the number of electorates in Gohad was 166893 and in Bhander was 139600. Subtracting the two, we get 27,293, which means Gohad had 27,293 more electorates than Bhander. Therefore, the statement "Gohad had 36732 more electorates in 2009 than Bhander" is supported by the table.
449	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, Sewda had the lowest number of electorates in 2009 with only 130161 electorates. Therefore, the statement "Sewda had the lowest number of electorates in 2009" is supported by the table.
450	Refuted. According to the table, Datia's constituency number is 22 and Gohad's constituency number is 13. Therefore, Datia's constituency number is actually higher than Gohad's by 9 (22 -13 = 9). Hence, the statement that "Datia's constituency number is higher than Gohad's by 9" is incorrect.
451	Refuted. The table provides information about the different constituencies within the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency and the number of electorates within each constituency. Based on the information provided, we cannot determine the number of times the results were counted in Bhind district or Datia. The table only provides information about the number of electorates in each constituency within the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency.
452	Refuted. According to the table, the number of electorates in Mehgaon was 210,649 and in Datia was 143,593. Therefore, the statement that "Mehgaon tied with Datia to have the highest number of electorates in 2009" is not supported by the table.
453	Refuted. According to the table, Gohad had 166893 electorates, while Bhander had 139600 electorates in 2009. Therefore, Gohad had 27393 more electorates than Bhander, not 16732. Hence, the statement that "Gohad had 16732 more electorates in 2009 than Bhander" is refuted.
454	Supported. According to the table, Sewda had 130161 electorates in 2009, which is the second-lowest number of electorates among the constituencies listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "sewda had the second lowest number of electorates in 2009" is supported by the table.
455	Refuted. According to the table, the constituency number for Datia is 22, and the constituency number for Gohad is 13. The difference between these two numbers is 9, not 10. Therefore, the statement that Datia's constituency number is lower than Gohad's by 10 is incorrect.

Therefore, he played in three events during 2002-2003, not just the two mentioned in the statement.
457	Supported. According to row 19 of the table, the only invitational event type in which Tsuyoshi Fujita participated was held in Los Angeles in May 2005. Therefore, the statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2005 season in Los Angeles" is supported by the table.
458	Partially refuted. According to the table, only one event (row 15: Grand Prix Bangkok) during the 2002-03 season was in the standard format. The other events during the 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04 seasons are not specified to be in the standard format. Therefore, the statement is partially refuted as only one event out of the three specified seasons featured a standard format.
459	Refuted. There is no information in the table regarding "season 5" and the location of the last two games being held in Los Angeles and London. The table shows the events and their locations and dates that Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in, but there is no mention of a season 5.
460	Refuted. The table lists an event where Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in 2011, but it is not the only event that year. The table does not provide any information about the number of events held in 2011, only the events in which Tsuyoshi Fujita participated.

462	Refuted. According to row 19 of the table, Tsuyoshi Fujita competed in an invitational event in Los Angeles in 2005. Therefore, the statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2002 season in Los Angeles" is incorrect.
463	Partially supported. Looking at the table, we can see that some of the events in the 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04 seasons were in the limited format, but not all of them. The following events were in the limited format during those seasons:- 1998-99 Grand Prix Kyoto (row 3)- 2000-01 Grand Prix Hiroshima (row 7)- 2001-02 Grand Prix Hong Kong (row 9)- 2001-02 Grand Prix Fukuoka (row 11)- 2002-03 Grand Prix Utsunomiya (row 13)Therefore, it can be said that some events in seasons 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04 were in the limited format, but not all of them.
464	Refuted. The table does not provide any indication of "season 5" and it doesn't show that the last 4 games in any season were held in both Los Angeles and London. The table only lists individual events with their respective locations and dates.

466	Supported. According to the table, there were three episodes that aired in January (on January 6th, January 13th, and January 20th) and only two episodes that aired in February (on February 3rd and February 10th), therefore the statement that "there were three episodes that aired in January, while only two aired in February" is supported by the table.
467	Supported. According to the table, five episodes of "Republic of Doyle" were aired during the month of March (on March 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31). None of the other months had more than two episodes aired. Therefore, the statement "March was the month that aired the most episodes with five" is supported by the table.
468	Supported. According to the table, "Fathers and Sons" (row 2) and "Duchess of George" (row 4) were both directed by Mike Clattenburg. Therefore, the statement "there were two episodes in the series that were directed by Mike Clattenburg" is supported by the table.
469	Supported. According to the table, there are three directors who directed two episodes each. Mike Clattenburg directed episodes 1 and 3, Steve Dimarco directed episodes 2 and 5, and Robert Lieberman directed episodes 7 and 10. Therefore, the statement "there are three different directors that directed two episodes" is supported by the table.
470	Refuted. According to the table, Mike Clattenburg directed 2 episodes (episodes 1 and 3) and Steve Scaini directed only 1 episode (episode 11). Therefore, Steve Scaini directed one less episode than Mike Clattenburg, making the statement false.
471	Refuted. According to the table, there were two episodes that aired in January (episodes 1 and 2) and two episodes that aired in February (episodes 5 and 6). Therefore, the statement "there were three episodes that aired in February, while only two aired in January" is incorrect.
472	Supported. According to the table, five episodes of "Republic of Doyle" aired in January. Therefore, the statement "January was the month that aired the most episodes with five" is supported by the table.
473	Refuted. According to the table, none of the episodes in the series were directed by Perry Chafe. The episodes were directed by Mike Clattenburg, Steve DiMarco, Larry McLean, Robert Lieberman, Jerry Ciccoritti, Phil Earnshaw, and Steve Scaini.
474	Refuted. According to the table, Mike Clattenburg and Robert Lieberman each directed two episodes (episode 1 and 3 for Clattenburg, and episodes 7 and 10 for Lieberman), which means there were directors who directed more than one episode.
475	Refuted. According to the table, Steve Scaini directed only one episode (row 11), whereas Mike Clattenburg directed two episodes (rows 1 and 3). Therefore, the statement that Steve Scaini directed one more episode than Mike Clattenburg is incorrect.
476	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, Carlos Cuéllar had the highest transfer fee of any player in the 2008-09 season with a fee of 7.8 million pounds for his transfer to Aston Villa.
477	Refuted. According to the table, out of the 34 transfers listed, only 12 involved Scottish (sco) teams. The statement that "sco had the highest amount of transfers at 22, more than every other team combined" is, therefore, incorrect.
478	Refuted. It is not possible to confirm that only seven players were transferred at the end of their contract without checking every row of the table, as some players may have left due to ending their contract at a different time, or relevant information may be missing from the table. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed or refuted based solely on the given table.
479	Refuted. According to the table, there are at least two players who moved to another club without a transfer fee. Jean-Claude Darcheville transferred to Valenciennes in the winter with a free transfer and Nicholas Gallacher moved to Motherwell at the end of his contract with a transfer fee listed as n/a. Therefore, the statement "Chris Burke was the only player to have a free transfer fee" is incorrect.
480	Supported. According to the table, 19 players were transferred during the summer window (rows 2-20), while only six players were transferred during the winter window (rows 27-32). Therefore, the statement that "nineteen players were transferred during the summer window as opposed to six during the winter window" is supported by the table.
481	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, Carlos Cuéllar was transferred to Aston Villa during the summer transfer window for a transfer fee of record low 7.8 million pounds, which is the lowest transfer fee among the players listed in the table. Therefore, the statement that "Carlos Cuéllar had the lowest transfer fee of any player at 7.8 m" is supported by the table.
482	Refuted. The table lists 29 transfers that involved Rangers FC during the 2008-09 season. Furthermore, the "Sco" designation in the first column indicates Scottish players, not the number of transfers. Therefore, the statement that "sco had the lowest amount of transfers at 22" is incorrect.
483	Supported. According to the table, players who moved to another club at the end of their contract include: Nicholas Gallacher, Lacine Cherif, Alistair Park, Michael Donald, Calum Reidford, Chris Smith, and Jeroen van den Broeck. This indicates that a total of seven players were transferred at the end of their contract. Therefore, the statement that ten players were transferred at the end of their contract is incorrect.
484	Supported. According to row 29 of the table, Chris Burke was one of the players who had a free transfer fee. Therefore, the statement that "Chris Burke was one of five players to have a free transfer fee" is supported by the table.
485	Supported. According to the table, there were 15 players transferred during the summer window (rows 2-19) and 5 players transferred during the winter window (rows 27-31). Therefore, the statement that "fifteen players were transferred during the summer window as opposed to eight during the winter window" is supported by the table.
486	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, Melbourne scored 8.10 (58) when playing as the away team against Collingwood. This is the lowest score among all the away teams in this table. Therefore, the statement "Melbourne had the lowest score when playing as the away team" is supported by the table.
487	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, the Collingwood vs Melbourne game had a crowd size of 30,883 which is larger than the other games listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "the Collingwood vs Melbourne game has the largest crowd size" is supported by the table.
488	Supported. According to the table, the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game, which took place at Junction Oval, was 7,007. The crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game, which took place at Windy Hill, was 22,251. Therefore, the statement that the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was smaller than the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game is supported by the table.
489	Refuted. To calculate the average of all the home team scores given in the table, we need to add up all the numbers in the second column and divide by the number of rows. Doing so, we get:(91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) / 6 = 620 / 6 ≈ 103.33Therefore, the average of all the home team scores is approximately 103.33, not 15.67.
490	Refuted. Only two out of six (not one out of three) away teams had a score greater than 10 - Richmond scored 111 points and Geelong scored 98 points. Therefore, the statement "1/3 of the away teams had a score greater than 10" is incorrect.
491	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, Melbourne scored 8.10 (58) as the away team, which was the second-lowest score in the game week. Therefore, the statement "Melbourne had the second-lowest score when playing as the away team" is supported by the table.
492	Refuted. According to the table, the crowd size for the Collingwood vs Melbourne game was 30883. Since the table only includes one game, we can't compare the crowd size of this game to other games. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the Collingwood vs Melbourne game has the third-largest crowd size or not.
493	Refuted. According to the table, the attendance for the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was 7007, whereas the attendance for the Essendon vs Richmond game was 22251, which is significantly higher. Therefore, the statement "more attended the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game than the Essendon vs Richmond game" is refuted by the table.
494	Refuted. To calculate the average of all the home team scores, we add up all the home team scores (91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) and divide by the total number of games (6). This gives us an average of approximately 105.83, which is greater than 12. Therefore, the statement "the average of all the home team scores is less than 12" is not supported by the table, and can, therefore, be regarded as refuted.
495	Refuted. Out of the six away teams included in the table, only two teams had a score greater than 10 (St Kilda with 9.11 (65) and Richmond with 17.9 (111)). Therefore, less than half of the away teams had a score greater than 10.
496	Supported. According to row 1 of the table, both the agricultural panel and labour panel have a total of 11 members each. The total number of members of the agricultural panel is 11 (4 from Fianna Fáil, 3 from Fine Gael, 2 from Clann Na Talmhan, and 2 independent members), while the total number of members in the labour panel is also 11 (5 from Labour Party, 1 from Independent, and 5 from the nominees of Taoiseach). Therefore, the statement "the agricultural panel and labour panel both have 11 total members" is supported by the table.
497	Supported. According to the table, Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, while Clann na Talmhan has a total of 3 members. Therefore, Fianna Fáil has 18 more members than Clann na Talmhan, as stated in the statement.
498	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, Fianna Fáil has seven members nominated by the Taoiseach, so University of Dublin is not the only group of origin made up entirely of members from one party. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
499	Refuted. According to the table, "nominated by the taoiseach" is not a party; it refers to members who are appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) rather than being elected. Therefore, it is not possible to compare it to parties in terms of the number of members.
500	Refuted. According to the table, the industrial and commercial panel has 9 members, while the cultural and educational panel has 5 members. Therefore, the industrial and commercial panel has 4 more members than the cultural and educational panel.
501	Supported. According to the table, the Agricultural Panel has 2 members and the Labour Panel has 5 members. Therefore, the statement "the Agricultural Panel has 2 members and the Labour Panel has 5 members" is supported by the table.
502	Supported. According to the table, Fianna Fáil has 21 members in the 5th Seanad, which is the highest total among all the parties. The party with the second highest members is Fine Gael with 9 members. Therefore, the statement "the party with 21 total members has 9 more members than the party with the second most members" is supported by the table.
503	Refuted. According to row 1 of the table, there are several groups of origin: - Administrative panel - Agricultural panel - Cultural and educational panel - Industrial and commercial panel - Labour panel - National University of Ireland - University of Dublin - Nominated by the Taoiseach Only two groups of origin have more than one party represented in them: - National University of Ireland (Fianna Fáil: 1, Fine Gael: 1, Independent: 1) - Nominated by the Taoiseach (Fianna Fáil: 7, Fine Gael: 0, Independent: 3) Therefore, the statement that the National University of Ireland is the only group of origin made up mostly of members from two parties is incorrect.
504	Refuted. According to the table, the Fianna Fáil party has the highest number of members from a single party, with a total of 11 members spread across different panels. However, the highest number of members from a single party in a panel is in the Administrative Panel, which is also occupied by Fianna Fáil with a total of 4 members. Therefore, the statement "agricultural panel has the most members from one party" is not supported by the table.
505	Supported. According to row 1 of the table, the Administrative Panel has 7 members, and the National University of Ireland Panel has 1 member, so the Administrative Panel has four more members than the National University of Ireland Panel.
506	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Asc Diaraf lost to Stade Malien with an aggregate score of 3-4 in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
507	Refuted. The scoring system used in the African Cup of Champions Clubs was based on aggregate goals over two legs, not points. Therefore, the statement "the young africans scored two points in the 1971 african cup of champions clubs" is not applicable in the context of this table.
508	Supported. According to row 9 of the table, Secteur 6 lost to Enugu Rangers with an aggregate score of 1-2 (one goal for Secteur 6 and two goals for Enugu Rangers). Therefore, the statement "secteur 6 lost by one against the enugu rangers" is supported by the table.
509	Refuted. According to row 6 of the table, As Porto Novo had an aggregate score of 0-3 against Victoria Club Mokanda, but that does not mean they scored no points. It is possible that they scored points in either or both of the two legs, but just not enough to win the tie. Therefore, the statement that "As Porto Novo scored no points against Victoria Club Mokanda" is not accurate.
510	Refuted. The information provided in the table does not indicate points scored by each team. The table only shows the aggregate score (agg) for each match, which is the total number of goals scored by each team over the two legs of the match. Therefore, the statement "canon yaoundé scored five more points than their opponent" cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
511	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, Stade Malien won against ASC Diaraf with an aggregate score of 4-3 in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. Therefore, the statement that ASC Diaraf won against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs is incorrect.
512	Refuted. The table shows that Young Africans won their tie against Lavori Publici. Therefore, the statement "the young africans scored zero points in the 1971 african cup of champions clubs" is incorrect.
513	Refuted. According to row 9 of the table, Enugu Rangers won the match against Secteur 6 with an aggregate score of 2-1 (1-1 in the first leg and 0-1 in the second leg). Therefore, the statement "Secteur 6 won against the Enugu Rangers" is not supported by the table.
514	Refuted. The table does not show points. It only shows the aggregate score of the two legs played between the two teams. According to the table, AS Porto-Novo lost both legs of their match against Victoria Club Mokanda with a score of 0-1 in the first leg and 0-2 in the second leg. Therefore, the statement "AS Porto-Novo scored three points against the Victoria Club Mokanda" is refuted by the table.
515	Refuted. The table does not show any team where they scored zero points against their opponent. Therefore, the statement that canon yaounde scored zero points against their opponent is not supported by the given table.
516	Refuted. Although there is a difference in attendance between the lowest and highest attendance figures in the table, which is calculated by subtracting the lowest attendance (22616) from the highest attendance (54137), the difference is not 31521. The actual difference is 31521 (highest attendance) - 22616 (lowest attendance) = 8915.
517	Refuted. According to the table, the Giants played a total of 4 games in the month of September against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Therefore, the statement that "the Giants played 7 games within the month of September" is not supported by the table.
518	Refuted. According to the table, there were no games played during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season where the score was more than 10 points, either in favor of them or their opponents. Therefore, the statement "2 games had a score of more than 10 points" is refuted by the table.
519	Refuted. The table does not suggest that an Arizona Diamondbacks player named Rosales had a 3x loss during September or any other time. While the "loss" column in the table indicates the winning pitcher for each game, it does not provide information on losses incurred by individual players.
520	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one record of attendance given that was over 50,000, which occurred during the game against the Dodgers on September 5th with a attendance of 52,270. Therefore, the statement "there were two times the attendance was over 50,000" is not supported by the table.
521	Refuted. The average attendance is not directly provided in the table, but we can calculate it by adding up the attendance values for each game and dividing by the total number of games:35075 + 27568 + 24350 + 52270 + 47543 + 54137 + 30252 + 30518 + 30992 + 29046 + 45075 + 27297 + 25969 + 33195 + 34323 + 43137 + 38283 + 32915 + 40349 + 40013 + 40029 + 40502 + 34950 + 33234 + 35908 = 890799There were a total of 81 games played during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season (not including playoffs), so the average attendance is:890799 / 81 = 11,001Therefore, the statement "the average number of people in the game is 31 521 during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season" is false.
522	Refuted. The table shows that both the Giants and the Cardinals played the same number of games in the month of September, with each team playing a total of 10 games against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Thus, the statement "the Giants have played more games than the Cardinals for the month of September" is refuted by the table.
523	Refuted. Looking at the table, none of the games have a score higher than 10 points for a single team. The highest score achieved by any team in a game mentioned in the table is 13, which was when the Diamondbacks won 13-4 against the Rockies on September 21. Therefore, the statement that there are more than 2 games that had a scored higher than 10 points is refuted by the table.
524	Refuted. The table does not provide information about the losses of individual players on the Arizona Diamondbacks team like Rosales or Johnson. The table only shows the scores, wins, losses, and attendance of the games played during the 2008 season. Therefore, the statement "Rosales of Arizona Diamond has more losses than Johnson" cannot be supported or refuted using the given table.
525	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against the Dodgers on September 5th was 52,270, which is the highest attendance recorded during the 2008 season. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendance of the season was on September 5" is supported by the table.
526	Refuted. According to the table, the highest combined agg (aggregate score) was in the match between Cd Elá Nguema and Primeiro de Agosto, which ended with an aggregate score of 2-6. The match involving Saint-Louis FC had an aggregate score of 2-7, which is not the highest compared to other matches. Therefore, the statement that the match involving Saint-Louis FC had the highest combined agg of any of the featured games is not supported by the table.
527	Refuted. According to the table, the fourth game on the list was CD Elá Nguema vs. Primeiro de Agosto, which had a combined total of 8 goals (2-6). The sixth game on the list was ASC Police vs. AS Real Bamako, which had a combined total of 4 goals (2-2). Therefore, the statement that "the 4th game on the list was a higher scoring game than the sixth game on the list" is false, it's the opposite.
528	Supported. According to the table, only one game (row 7) had a score of 0-0 in the first leg, which is less than two. Therefore, the statement "there were only two games where the score was 0 - 0 for the 1st leg" is supported by the table.
529	Refuted. According to the table, the aggregate (agg) score for Botswana Defence Force XI in the first round was 1-2, whereas Arsenal (Maseru) scored an aggregate of 4-0. This means that Botswana Defence Force XI had a higher aggregate than Arsenal (Maseru). Therefore, the statement that Botswana Defence Force XI had a lower aggregate than Arsenal (Maseru) is false.
530	Refuted. According to the table, the Botswana Defence Force XI scored 1 goal in the 1st leg, while Asc Police scored only 1 goal in each of the two legs against As Real Bamako. Therefore, the statement that "the Botswana Defence Force XI and the Asc Police games have the same 1st leg score" is incorrect.
531	Refuted. The game between Saint-Louis FC and Young Africans with a combined aggregate of 9 (2-7) has the highest combined aggregate compared to any of the other featured games. Therefore, the statement that the game between Saint-Louis FC and Eleven Arrows FC has the highest combined aggregate is incorrect.
532	Refuted. The table does not provide the score in terms of which game had a higher score, so we cannot compare the scores of Port Autonome versus Sporting Clube da Praia and LPRC Oilers versus Mighty Blackpool.
533	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, the first leg between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia had a score of 0-0 and the same score was repeated in the second leg. Therefore, there was a total of two games and two legs that had a score of 0-0.
534	Refuted. According to the table, Botswana Defence Force XI had an aggregate (agg) score of 1-2, which is not the lowest aggregate score in the season. LPRC Oilers had an aggregate score of 2-3 and Saint-Louis FC had an aggregate score of 2-7, both of which are lower than Botswana Defence Force XI's. Therefore, the statement "Botswana Defence Force XI has the lowest agg in the season" is refuted by the table.
535	Refuted. According to the table, there is no evidence that more than two teams had the same score during the first leg of their respective matches. Therefore, the statement "there are more than two teams that have the same score during the 1st leg" is refuted by the table.
536	Supported. According to the table, Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games in 2008 (in Beijing, PR China) where he achieved 29th position, and in 2012 (in London, Great Britain) where he achieved 6th position. Therefore, the statement "Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games two times" is supported by the table.
537	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, Lukáš Melich placed 3rd in the world championships in Moscow in 2013. Therefore, the statement "Lukáš Melich placed third place or higher in one competition" is supported by the table.
538	Supported. According to the table, Lukáš Melich participated in two junior championships: the World Junior Championships in Annecy, France in 1998 (position 10th, notes 61.51 m) and the European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia in 1999 (position 5th, notes 64.20 m). Therefore, the statement "the competition type was a junior championship two times" is supported by the table.
539	Refuted. According to the table, Lukáš Melich participated in a total of ten competitions. However, only three of them were worldwide championships (World Championships or Olympic Games) - 2005 World Championships, 2008 Olympic Games, and 2013 World Championships. Therefore, the statement "four of the competitions out of ten were worldwide championships" is not supported by the table.
540	Refuted. Lukáš Melich's last two competitions were the Olympic Games in London in 2012 and the World Championships in Moscow in 2013. According to the table, his distances in those competitions were 77.17 m and 79.36 m, respectively. The average of these two distances is 78.265 m, which is close to but not exactly 78.27 m. Therefore, the statement that he threw an average distance of 78.27 m in his last two competitions is not completely accurate.
541	Refuted. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's best result at the Olympic Games was 6th place in 2012, where he did not win a medal. Therefore, the statement that Lukáš Melich won a medal at the Olympic Games is refuted by the table.
542	Refuted. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's best finish was third place in the World Championships in 2013 with a throw of 79.36m. Therefore, the statement "Lukáš Melich's best finish was second" is refuted by the provided table.
543	Refuted. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's highest finish was actually third place in the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Russia. This performance occurred when he was no longer a junior athlete, therefore, the statement that his highest finish was as a junior is refuted by the table.
544	Supported. According to the table, Lukáš Melich participated in five different world championships; one of them was the world junior championship, indicated in row 2, and the other four were senior world championships (in 2005, 2009, 2013, as shown in rows 6, 9, and 11, respectively). Therefore, the statement "four of the competitions were senior world championships" is supported by the table.
545	Refuted. According to row 11 of the table, Lukáš Melich threw for 79.36 m, which is greater than 78 m. Therefore, the statement "Lukáš Melich never threw for greater than 78 m" is refuted by the table.
546	Refuted. Based on the table, none of the teams scored less than 10 points. The scores range from 49 to 121, and all teams scored at least 65 points. Therefore, the statement "only two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored less than 10" is not supported by the table.
547	Refuted. According to the table, the Geelong team, which was the home team in the match against Hawthorn, scored 11.23 (89) while the North Melbourne team, also a home team, scored 11.5 (71) against Carlton. Therefore, at least two home teams scored less than 11, and the statement "there were no home teams that scored less than 11" is false.
548	Supported. According to the table, Carlton scored the highest number of points (121) among all the teams that played on June 18, 1938, compared to other teams that scored 49, 56, 89, 96, 99, and 104 points. Therefore, the statement "the highest scoring team for the games that happened on the 18th of June was Carlton" is supported by the table.
549	Refuted. According to the table, the game between Richmond and Essendon on 18 June 1938 at Punt Road Oval drew a crowd of 20,000. Therefore, the statement "no game on the 18th of June drew a crowd of more than 20,000" is incorrect.
550	Refuted. According to the table, only 2 home teams had higher scores than the away teams they were playing. These home teams with higher scores than their away team opponents were Geelong and Richmond, whereas St Kilda lost to Melbourne. Therefore, the statement "3 home teams had higher scores than the away teams that they were playing" is not supported by the table.
551	Refuted. According to the table, three teams (Melbourne, Essendon, and Carlton) scored more than 10. Therefore, the statement "only two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored more than 10" is false.
552	Refuted. According to the table, the home team Geelong scored 89 points, which is more than 11. Therefore, the statement "there were no home teams that scored more than 11" is not supported by the table.
553	Supported. According to the table, Carlton scored 16.25 (121) points in their game against North Melbourne on June 18th, which is the second-highest score among the games played on that day. Therefore, the statement "the second highest scoring team for the games that happened on the 18th of June was by Carlton" is supported by the table.
554	Refuted. According to the table, the game between Geelong and Hawthorn at Corio Oval on 18 June 1938 drew a crowd of 7000, which is fewer than 20000. Therefore, the statement "no game on the 18th of June drew a crowd of fewer than 20000" is false.
555	Refuted. According to the table, no pair of home and away teams had the same score in any match. Therefore, the statement "two home teams had the same scores as the away teams that they were playing" is refuted.
556	Supported. According to the table, Alberto Pagani has won with only two teams, which are Linto and MV Agusta. He secured one win with each of these teams. Therefore, the statement that "Alberto Pagani has only won with two teams: Linto and MV Agusta" is supported.
557	Refuted. According to row 22 and row 27-28 of the table, Alberto Pagani won in the 500cc class as well as in the 125cc, 350cc, and 500cc classes. Therefore, not all of Alberto Pagani's wins are in the 500cc class, so the statement is refuted.
558	Supported. According to row 27 and 28, Alberto Pagani won two times in the same year, in the 500cc class, during 1971. This is the only time he achieved this feat, so the statement is supported by the table.
559	Unsupported. The table provided does not allow us to calculate the average points for Pagani's wins across all races he contested in. The table only provides the number of points and wins he achieved for certain teams in specific years and classes. Therefore, the statement that Pagani averages 40 points in races he wins cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
560	Supported. According to the table, Alberto Pagani has raced for Aermacchi a total of five times, which is more than any other team listed in the table. The statement that "Alberto Pagani has raced for Aermacchi ten times, more than any other team" is therefore supported by the table.
561	Refuted. According to row 22 of the table, Alberto Pagani won the 500cc class with Linto in 1969, and according to row 27 and 28, he won the 500cc class with both Linto and MV Agusta in 1971. Therefore, he won with three teams (Ducati, Aermacchi, Honda, Kreidler, Paton, and Suzuki) and not just Linto and MV Agusta, and he won with teams both before and after 1967. Hence, the statement is refuted by the table.
562	Refuted. According to the table, Alberto Pagani had two wins, one in 1969 in the 500cc class and another in 1971, where he won in both the 500cc class, and with a different team, in the 500cc class again. Also, his average points across all classes are 4.96, much lower than 87, and he did not win any championships. Therefore, the statement "all of Alberto Pagani's win is of the 500cc class, with an average points of 87" is refuted by the table.
563	Refuted. According to the table, Alberto Pagani did not win any races in the 250cc class in 1971 (or in any other year for that matter). He did win two races in 1971, one each in the 500cc class riding for Linto and MV Agusta, but not in the 250cc class. Therefore, the statement "1971 was the only year Alberto Pagani won two times in the same year, in the 250cc class" is incorrect.
564	Refuted. According to the table, Alberto Pagani never won a race in the 250cc class. Therefore, there is no data available to determine his average points in races he won in the 250cc class, and the statement is incorrect.
565	Refuted. According to the table, Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi six times, not ten times. He also did not win any of those races, as all his entries are marked with 0 wins.
566	Supported. According to the table, the New York Jets played eight games during the 1993 season at the game site name "the meadowlands". Therefore, the statement "during the 1993 New York Jets season, the New York Jets played eight games at the game site name the meadowlands" is supported by the table.
567	Refuted. All of the attendance figures listed in the table are well above 7,000, with the lowest being 41,810 in Week 13 against the New England Patriots. Therefore, it seems likely that the statement is a typographical error and was intended to read "six games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season." However, this statement is also false, as only three games had an official attendance figure over 70,000: Week 5 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills, and Week 15 against the Dallas Cowboys.
568	Refuted. The New York Jets won a total of 8 games and lost 8 games during the 1993 season, as can be seen by the results in the table. Therefore, the statement that the New York Jets took the same amount of wins as losses during the 1993 season is incorrect.
569	Supported. According to row 2 and row 3 of the table, the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos first and then the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season. Therefore, the statement that the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos before the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season is supported by the table.
570	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the Jets' first game against the Miami Dolphins (which they lost) was 68130, and the attendance for the second game (which they won) was 71306. Therefore, the Jets had 992 more people in attendance in their second game against the Miami Dolphins compared to their first game against them during the 1993 season.
571	Refuted. According to the table, the New York Jets only played one game at the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium during the 1993 season, which was in week 15 against the Washington Redskins. Therefore, the statement that the Jets played eight games at that stadium during the 1993 season is incorrect.
572	Refuted. According to the table, only three games (Week 3, Week 7, and Week 15) had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season. Therefore, the statement that eight games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season is incorrect.
573	Supported. According to the table, the New York Jets won 8 games and lost 8 games during the 1993 season. Therefore, the statement that the New York Jets took three more wins over losses during the 1993 season is supported by the table.
574	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, the New York Jets played their first game of the 1993 season against the Denver Broncos on September 5, 1993, and then went on to play the Miami Dolphins on September 12, 1993, which was their second game of the season. Therefore, the statement that the New York Jets played the Miami Dolphins before the Denver Broncos during the 1993 season is incorrect.
575	Refuted. According to the table, the New York Jets played the New England Patriots twice during the 1993 season - in Week 4 and Week 13. The Jets had an attendance of 64,836 in their first game against the Patriots and an attendance of 42,810 in their second game against them. Therefore, the statement that the Jets had 992 more people in attendance in their second game against the Patriots than their first game is incorrect.
576	Supported. According to the table, Brian Sipe started in 112 games while Bernie Kosar started in 105 games. Therefore, Sipe started seven more games than Kosar, supporting the statement that "Brian Sipe started seven more games than Bernie Kosar".
577	Supported. According to the table, the rows with quarterbacks Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar, and George Ratterman all have two different uniform numbers listed. Brian Sipe has uniform numbers 17 listed, while Bernie Kosar has uniform numbers 19, and George Ratterman has uniform numbers 12 and 16 listed. Therefore, the statement "three of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have two different uniform numbers" is supported by the table.
578	Supported. According to row 1 of the table, the Cleveland Browns have a total of 10 ties recorded in the "Ties" column. Therefore, the statement that "the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of ten games" is supported by the table.
579	Refuted. There are several quarterbacks in the table who have won at least 10 games as a starter for the Cleveland Browns (i.e., have at least 10 wins in the "wins" column): - Sipe, Brian: 57 wins- Kosar, Bernie: 53 wins- Ryan, Frank: 52 wins- Graham, Otto: 57 wins- Couch, Tim: 22 wins- Nelsen, Bill: 34 wins- Phipps, Mike: 24 wins- Plum, Milt: 33 wins- Anderson, Derek: 16 wins- Testaverde, Vinny: 16 wins- McDonald, Paul: 8 winsTherefore, the statement that only ten Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 10 games is refuted by the table.
580	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, Otto Graham won 57 games, lost 13 games, and tied 1 game during his time as a starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. Therefore, 57-13 = 44 more games won than lost, which confirms that the statement "Otto Graham has won 44 more games than he lost" is supported.
581	Supported. According to rows 2 and 3 of the table, Brian Sipe started 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started 105 games. Therefore, Sipe started eight more games than Kosar. Thus, the statement "Brian Sipe started eight more games than Bernie Kosar" is supported by the table.
582	Supported.

Therefore, the statement "four of the Cleveland Browns' starting quarterbacks have two different uniform numbers" is supported by the table.
583	Supported. According to the table, the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of 12 games, as indicated by the "ties" column. Therefore, the statement that "the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of twelve games" is supported by the table.
584	Supported. According to the table, there are only four Cleveland Browns quarterbacks who have won more than 50 games: Sipe, Brian; Kosar, Bernie; Ryan, Frank; and Graham, Otto. There are six quarterbacks who have won between 30 and 50 games: Nelsen, Bill; Phipps, Mike; Plum, Milt; Anderson, Derek; Testaverde, Vinny; and Holcomb, Kelly. Therefore, the statement "only ten Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games" is supported by the table.
585	Supported. According to the table, Otto Graham has 57 wins and Brady Quinn has 3 wins. Therefore, Otto Graham has won 54 more games than Brady Quinn.
586	Refuted. According to the table, Vicente Fernández and Nick Job both finished the 1981 Open Championship with a score of 70, which is even or "par" for the course as indicated by "e" in the "to par" column. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 Open Championship no player finished under par" is incorrect.
587	Supported. According to the table, there were eight players who tied for 9th place in the 1981 Open Championship. The players and their scores are listed in rows 10 through 17 of the table. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 open championship there were eight players that tied for 9th" is supported by the table.
588	Refuted. According to the table, England had six players in the 1981 Open Championship (Nick Job, Tony Jacklin, Howard Clark, David Jagger, Mark James, and Sam Torrance), while the United States had five players (Johnny Miller, Hal Sutton, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, and the amateur Simon Owen). Therefore, the statement that England and the United States had the same number of players in the 1981 Open Championship with five each is incorrect.
589	Refuted. The winning score for the 1981 Open Championship was not 72. Vicente Fernández and Nick Job tied for the first place with a score of 70 (which was even par), not 72. Moreover, there were several players who scored 72 (which was +2) and tied for ninth place. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 Open Championship the winning score was 72, with two players tying for this score" is incorrect.
590	Refuted. According to the table, there was a tie for the first place (between Vicente Fernandez and Nick Job), but in other positions, there was no tie. Players occupying joint positions are listed with "T" before the position number (e.g. T3). Therefore, the statement that "in the 1981 open championship no one player achieved their position alone, in other words there was a tie at every position" is incorrect.
591	Refuted. According to the table, Vicente Fernández and Nick Job both finished with a score of 70, which means they finished the tournament at even par. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 open championship no player finished under par except Isao Aoki" is incorrect.
592	Refuted. According to the table, there were seven players who tied for 3rd place and eight players who tied for 9th place, which makes the statement incorrect.
593	Refuted. According to the table, England had four players (Nick Job, Tony Jacklin, Howard Clark, and David Jagger), Australia had two players (David Graham and Greg Norman), and the United States had six players (Johnny Miller, Hal Sutton, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, Ben Crenshaw, and the amateur Simon Owen). Therefore, the statement that England, Australia, and the United States had the same number of players (five each) is incorrect.
594	Refuted. The statement is incorrect. The winning score was not 72, but rather was a score of even par (represented in the table as "e"), which was achieved by Vicente Fernández and Nick Job who tied for the top spot with a score of 70. Isao Aoki and David Graham are tied for third place with a score of +1 (71), as indicated in rows 4 and 5 of the table.
595	Refuted. According to the table, Vicente Fernández of Argentina and Nick Job of England both finished at the top of the leaderboard with a score of 70, meaning they achieved their position alone. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 open championship no one player achieved their position alone except Argentina" is incorrect.
596	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played against the Padres four times during the 2005 season on September 1, September 2, September 3, and September 4. Therefore, the statement "the Padres were the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season opponent four times" is supported by the table.
597	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played against the San Diego Padres on September 1, September 2, September 3, and September 4 and then played against the Cincinnati Reds starting on September 5 and continuing for several games. Therefore, the statement that "the Reds in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season played them after the Padres" is supported by the table.
598	Refuted. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played a total of 28 games in September 2005, but there is no information indicating that any game in the season had one team scoring no points. Therefore, the statement that "there are 4 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season where one team scored no points" is not supported by the table.
599	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played the Cardinals on September 23, 2005 (row 21), and then played the Reds on September 26, 2005 (row 24). Therefore, there was only one day in between these two games. So, the statement "the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2005 season played the Cardinals one day before the Reds" is supported by the table.
600	Refuted. According to the table, only 2 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season had an attendance of more than 30,000 people. All the other games, except for one game on September 3rd with an attendance of 32,022, had less than 30,000 people in the audience. Therefore, the statement "8 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season were attended by more than 30,000 people" is not supported by the table.
601	Supported. According to the table, the Cubs were the Milwaukee Brewers' opponent four times during the 2005 season, on September 20, 21, 22, and 24. Therefore, the statement "the Cubs were the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season opponent four times" is supported by the table.
602	Supported. According to the table, on September 9, 2005, the Milwaukee Brewers played against the Astros, and on September 3, 2005, they played against the Padres. As September 9 is a later date than September 3, the statement that "in 2005 the Milwaukee Brewers played the Astros after the Padres" is supported by the table.
603	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one game (row 23, September 25 against the Cardinals) where the Milwaukee Brewers scored no points. Therefore, the statement that there were 10 games where one team scored no points is incorrect.
604	Refuted. There is no mention of the New York Yankees in the table. The opponents listed in the table are Padres, Reds, Astros, Diamondbacks, Cubs, Cardinals, and Pirates. Therefore, the statement "in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season played the Yankees only two times" is not supported by the table.
605	Refuted. According to the table, the highest attendance recorded in the 2005 season for the Milwaukee Brewers was 37756 on September 17th against the Astros, but after that game, none of the attendance figures exceeded 31137, which is less than 30000. Therefore, the statement "in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season were attended by more than 30000 people for every game" is refuted.
606	Supported. According to the table, in five of the seven games listed, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists, while Deron Williams led in only two games. Therefore, the statement "Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did" is supported by the table.

Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
608	Partially supported. The only win mentioned in the table (row 4) did indeed come at the Prudential Center. However, it is not clear from the table whether the Nets had any other wins during the 2010-11 season that are not listed in the table. Therefore, while the statement is true for the specific information provided in the table, it cannot be determined based on the table whether it is true for the entire season.
609	Supported. According to row 3 to row 7 of the table, Brook Lopez was the player who scored the highest points for the New Jersey Nets in five consecutive games against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, and Charlotte Bobcats.

610	Supported. According to the table, the game against Miami on April 3 at the Prudential Center had an attendance of 18,711, which is the highest attendance recorded in the table. Therefore, the statement "the most highly attended game was against Miami at the Prudential Center" is supported by the table.
611	Refuted. According to the table, Deron Williams led the team in assists for three games (April 1, April 3, and April 6), whereas Brook Lopez only led the team in assists for one game (April 11). Therefore, the statement "Brook Lopez led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did" is refuted by the table.
612	Refuted. According to the table, there is no mention of Travis Outlaw leading the team in both points and rebounds in a single game even once, let alone three times. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
613	Supported. According to the table, the New Jersey Nets won only one game during the 2010-11 season, and that was against the Toronto Raptors at the Air Canada Centre on April 10th with a score of 92-99. Therefore, the statement "the Nets' only win came at the Air Canada Centre" is supported by the table.
614	Refuted. According to the table, Jordan Farmar did not lead the team in points in any of the given games. In fact, in the game against Minnesota on April 5th, 2011, he only had a total of 4 points. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
615	Refuted. According to the table, the game against the New York Knicks on April 8th had the highest attendance of 18,023 people at the Prudential Center. The game against Minnesota only had 13,461 attendees. Therefore, the statement "the most highly attended game was against Minnesota at the Prudential Center" is refuted by the table.
616	Supported. According to the table, Mark Brooks is the player who won the 1996 PGA Championship and earned $430,000 in prize money. No other player won more money than him, so the statement that "Mark Brooks is the player who earned the most money" is supported by the table.
617	Supported. According to the table, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both had a score of 277 and a to-par of -11, which is the lowest to-par score on the table. Therefore, the statement that "Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tied for having the lowest to-par" is supported by the table.

620	Refuted. According to row 2 and row 3 of the table, Mark Brooks won the tournament and earned $430,000, while Kenny Perry finished second and earned $260,000. Therefore, Kenny Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks. Hence, the statement "Kenny Perry earned 170000 less than Mark Brooks" is supported by the table.
621	Refuted. According to the table, Mark Brooks is the player who earned the most money as he won the tournament and received a prize money of $430,000. Kenny Perry finished second, tied with Mark Brooks, and received a prize money of $260,000. Therefore, the statement "Kenny Perry is the player who earned the most money" is refuted by the table.
622	Supported. According to row 2 and row 3 of the table, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both scored 277, which was the lowest score in the tournament. Additionally, they both finished with a score of -11, which was the lowest "to par" score. Therefore, the statement that "Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tied for having the lowest to par" is supported by the table.
623	Refuted. The statement is false because there are several players from the United States listed in the table, including the winner of the tournament, Mark Brooks; Phil Mickelson himself, who tied for 8th place; and several other players who also represented the United States.
624	Supported. According to the table, Frank Nobilo is the only player listed who is from Zimbabwe. Therefore, the statement that "Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe" is supported by the table.
625	Refuted. According to the table, Mark Brooks won the 1996 PGA Championship and earned $430,000 in prize money, while Kenny Perry finished second and earned $260,000 in prize money. Therefore, the statement that "Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks" is incorrect.
626	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, the Zakspeed 891 chassis was equipped with a Yamaha V8 engine. Therefore, the statement "the Zakspeed 891 chassis has a Yamaha V8 engine" is supported by the table.
627	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the Zakspeed 841 chassis was used in the year 1985. Therefore, the statement that "the Zakspeed 841 chassis was from the year 1985" is supported by the table.
628	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, in the year 1987, two zakspeed chassis were made: the zakspeed 861 and the zakspeed 871.
629	None
630	Refuted. The table shows that the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used only in the chassis for the 1985, 1986, and 1987 seasons. In 1988, they used the same engine but with a different chassis, and in 1989 they switched to a completely different engine. Therefore, the statement that the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used on all chassis from 1985 until 1988 is not supported by the table.
631	Refuted. According to the table, the Zakspeed 891 chassis was equipped with only one engine, specifically a Yamaha V8. Therefore, the statement that "the Zakspeed 891 chassis has multiple Yamaha V8 engines" is incorrect.
632	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the Zakspeed 841 was the only chassis that Zakspeed used in 1985. So, the statement "the Zakspeed 841 chassis was the only chassis from the year 1985" is supported by the table.
633	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, there were two different Zakspeed chassis made in 1987, the Zakspeed 861 and the Zakspeed 871. Therefore, the statement "there were more than two Zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987" is true.
634	Partially supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 861 chassis was used in the year 1986 (row 3) and the same chassis along with Zakspeed 871 was used in the year 1987 (row 4). So, the statement that the 861 chassis was made in the years 1986 and 1987 is partially supported as it was made in 1986 and used again in 1987 along with another chassis.
635	Supported. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense have 13 points, which makes them hold the first two positions with an equal number of points.
636	Supported. According to the table, Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points, but Flamengo has a goal difference of 8 while Fluminense has a goal difference of 10, indicating that they are separated by goal difference. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
637	Refuted. According to the table, only two teams have scored more goals than those against them, namely Flamengo and Fluminense. Additionally, three teams have a positive goal difference (meaning they have scored more goals than they have conceded): Flamengo, Fluminense, and Corinthians. Therefore, the statement "four of the teams have a minus goal difference while only four have scored more goals than those against them" is not supported by the table.
638	The table does not provide information about the number of goals scored against each team except for the total number of goals conceded by each team (the "against" column). Therefore, we cannot determine whether two teams had the same number of goals scored against them or not. The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
639	Refuted. While Flamengo and Fluminense tied on points, there is no such record of the third team (Corinthians) having the same number of points as well. Therefore, the statement "three teams tie on points but are separated by goal difference" is not supported by the table.
640	Refuted. According to the table, the teams in the first 2 positions (Flamengo and Fluminense) had the same number of points (13) and didn't have a difference of 2. So the statement that the teams held a different amount of points with the 2nd team falling behind by 2 is incorrect.
641	Refuted. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense have the same number of points (13) at the top of the table. Therefore, the statement that the second team had less points than the first is incorrect. Additionally, the goal difference between the two teams is 2, not 2 goals, as the difference is calculated by subtracting the number of goals against from the number of goals played.
642	Refuted. According to the table, only 2 teams (Portuguesa and América) had a negative goal difference, which means that less than 3 teams held a minus goal difference. Additionally, only 2 teams (Fluminense and Corinthians) had fewer than 10 goals scored against them, while 5 teams had 19 or more goals scored against them, which means that more than 5 teams had scored more goals against them. Therefore, the statement "less than 3 teams hold a minus goal difference, while more than 5 have scored more goals against them" is refuted by the table.
643	Refuted. There is no information in the table provided about the number of goals scored against the teams. The table only provides information about the points, games played, and goal difference for each team. Therefore, the statement that "over three teams have the same number of goals scored against them" cannot be supported or refuted by this table.
644	Refuted. According to the table, Flamengo and Fluminense both finished with 13 points, which means they tied on points and for the first position. However, it is true that most teams were separated by more than a 1-goal difference, with the exception of Fluminense and Palmeiras who had a 3-goal difference.
645	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score in the match against South Melbourne was 12.16 (88), which is higher than Geelong's home team score of 13.12 (90) in their match against Hawthorn. Therefore, the statement "Collingwood did not have a home team score higher than that of Geelong" is not supported by the table.
646	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, Melbourne scored the highest away team score of 15.4 (94) against Richmond. Therefore, the statement "Melbourne is the team with the highest away team score" is supported by the table.
647	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, the home team (North Melbourne) and away team (Footscray) both scored 9.14 (68) during their game at Arden Street Oval. Therefore, the statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at arden street oval" is supported by the table.
648	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood had a home team score of 12.16 (88) while Carlton had a home team score of 10.16 (76). Therefore, the home team score of Collingwood was only 1.84 points higher than that of Carlton, not 2.00 points higher.
649	Refuted. According to the table, Kardinia Park was the only venue where the home team (Geelong) scored higher than the away team (Hawthorn) in that round. Therefore, the statement "Kardinia Park was one of two venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score" is not supported by the table.
650	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88), which is not three times higher than Geelong's home team score of 13.12 (90). Therefore, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score that was three times higher than that of Geelong" is not supported by the table.
651	Refuted. According to the table, the away team with the highest score is Melbourne with a score of 15.4 (94) in their match against Richmond. The away team score for Fitzroy in their match against St Kilda was 9.15 (69), which is lower than Melbourne's score. Therefore, the statement "Fitzroy is the team with the highest away team score" is refuted by the table.
652	Supported. According to row 7 in the table, St Kilda scored 13.14 (92) and Fitzroy scored 9.15 (69) at the Junction Oval. The home team and away team scores are different, so the statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at junction oval" is not true for this game.
653	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) while Carlton's home team score was 10.16 (76), which means Collingwood's score was only 2.00 points higher than that of Carlton. Therefore, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score 3.00 points higher than that of Carlton" is refuted by the table.
654	Refuted. According to the table, only one venue is mentioned, which is Kardinia Park where the home team Geelong scored higher than the away team Hawthorn. However, there's no mention of any other venues in the table where the same condition applies. Therefore, we cannot say that Kardinia Park was one of three venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score.
655	Supported. According to the table, the imperial value for both 厘 (lei4) and 分 (fan1) is ~0.2133 dr (drams). Therefore, the statement "the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 is ~0.2133 dr" is supported by the table.

657	Supported. According to rows 6 and 7 of the table, 斤 (jīn) and 担 / 擔 (dàn) have a relative value of 1 and 100, respectively, which means that the value of these units is at least 1. Therefore, the statement "斤 and 担 / 擔 both have a relative value that 's at least 1" is supported by the table.
658	Supported. According to the table, 担 / 擔 has a metric value of 60.478982 kg, which is the only value mentioned in kilograms. Therefore, the statement that 担 / 擔 is the only character that has a metric value measured in kg is supported by the table.
659	Supported. According to the table, 錢, 兩, and 斤 all have metric values provided in grams. These values are 3.779936375 g, 37.79936375 g, and 604.78982 g, respectively. Therefore, the statement "錢, 兩, and 斤 all have metric values that are measured in g" is supported by the table.
660	Refuted. According to the table, the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 is approximately 0.2133 dr, and they are equal. Therefore, the statement "the imperial values for 厘 and 分 are not equal" is refuted.
661	False. According to the table, both the 厘 (lei4) and 分 (fan1) have the same relative value, i.e. 1/1600. Therefore, the statement "the relative values for 厘 and 分 are different from each other" is refuted by the table.

665	Partially supported. According to the table, Manchester United was 3rd in league position on September 18, 2005 (after they drew with Liverpool). However, they were in 2nd place in the league position from November 19, 2005 until the end of the season on May 7, 2006. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has been 2nd in league position since 17 November 2005" is partially supported.
666	Supported. According to the table, Manchester United has played against Portsmouth only twice since 13 August 2005 - once on 3 December 2005 (H) and once on 11 February 2006 (A). Both times, Manchester United won against Portsmouth with scores of 3-0 and 3-1 respectively. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has beaten Portsmouth 2 out of two times since 13 August 2005" is supported by the table.
667	Refuted. The table shows that Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers only once during the 2005-2006 season, on September 24, 2005, and lost the match 2-1. Therefore, the statement that Manchester United lost to Blackburn Rovers 2 out of 2 times since August 13, 2005, is incorrect.
668	Refuted. The table provides information only for the 2005-06 season of Manchester United and there is no information provided about other games or events that occurred during or after that season.

669	Supported. According to the table, the game with the lowest attendance was on 11 February 2006 against Blackburn Rovers, where only 25,484 people attended the match. Therefore, the statement that "the game with the lowest attendance happened on 11 February 2006" is supported by the table.
670	Refuted. According to the table, Manchester United beat Portsmouth 3-0 on December 3, 2005, won against them 4-1 on December 31, 2005, and won again 3-1 on February 11, 2006. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has always lost 3 out of three times to Portsmouth since 10 September 2005" is incorrect.
671	Refuted. According to the table, Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers only once during the 2005-06 season (on September 24, 2005), in which they lost 1-2 at home (Old Trafford). Therefore, Manchester United did not draw all matches against Blackburn Rovers two out of two times since August 13, 2005.
672	Refuted. The attendance for the Arsenal game on 9 April 2006 was 70,908, and according to the table, no other game in the 2005-06 Manchester United season had exactly the same attendance.

673	Refuted. According to the table, the last game of the 2005-06 Manchester United F.C. season happened on May 7, 2006, against Charlton Athletic. Therefore, the statement that the last game of the season happened on February 11, 2006, is incorrect.
674	Supported. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played against the Seattle Mariners a total of 9 times during the 2006 season. These games took place on September 8, September 9, September 10, September 17, September 18, September 19, September 20, September 29, and September 30. Therefore, the statement "in the 2006 season the Texas Rangers played the Mariners nine times" is supported by the table.
675	Refuted. According to the table, the games were played from September 1 to October 1 of the 2006 season, meaning that not all games were played in September. Therefore, the statement "all games in the 2006 season were played in the month of September" is false.
676	Refuted. According to the table, there was no game with a final score of 7-2 in the 2006 Texas Rangers season. Therefore, the statement "the final game score was 7-2 in two different games of the 2006 season" is refuted by the table.

Therefore, the statement "in three different baseball games the final score was 8 - 1" is supported by the table.
679	Refuted. According to the table, in the 2006 season, the Texas Rangers played the Los Angeles Angels (not the Texas Mariners) three times on September 14, 15, and 16. Therefore, the statement that the Texas Mariners played the Angels nine times in the 2006 season is incorrect.
680	Refuted. The table is for the 2006 season of the Texas Rangers baseball team, not the 2007 season. Additionally, looking at the dates in the first column in the table shows that the games were played in September and October of 2006, not just in October as in the statement. Therefore, the statement "all games in the 2007 season were played in the month of October" is not supported by the table, and in fact, the table is not related to the 2007 season at all.
681	Refuted. The table is for the 2006 Texas Rangers season and does not include any games from the 2007 season. Additionally, there is no game in the table that ended with a final score of 8-3, let alone two different games. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.

685	Supported. According to the table, the last episode of the season ("Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal") had the least number of viewers with a rating of 1.7/5 and a total of 5.55 million viewers, which is the lowest of all the episodes.

686	Supported. According to the "timeslot" column of the table, all the episodes of Gary Unmarried season 1 aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm, which supports the statement.
687	Refuted. None of the episode titles in season 1 of Gary Unmarried feature the names of both Gary and Allison. While some episodes focus on their relationship, the titles do not feature both of their names.
688	Cannot be determined. The table only goes up until May 20, 2009, so it does not provide information about December of that year or any episodes beyond that date. It's possible that there were only two new episodes aired during that time, but the table does not support or refute that statement.
689	Refuted. According to the table, the episode with the least amount of viewers was "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal," which aired on May 20, 2009, and had 1.7 / 5 in the 18-49 demographic and 5.55 million viewers.

691	Refuted. According to the table, Gary Unmarried aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm and not Fridays at 8:00 pm. Therefore, the statement "Gary Unmarried came on Fridays at 8:00 pm" is refuted by the table.
692	Refuted. According to the table, not every episode in season one mentions both Gary and Allison.  For example, episodes 5 ("Gary Breaks Up His Ex-Wife and Girlfriend"), 7 ("Gary Meets the Gang"), and 15 ("Gary and Dennis' Sister") do not mention Allison in the title.
693	Refuted. According to the table, the latest episode aired on May 20, 2009. However, it does not rule out the possibility that episodes were aired in December 2009. Therefore, the statement that no episodes of Gary Unmarried aired in December 2009 cannot be confirmed or refuted by the given table.
694	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics had already lost 9 games by the end of January 1985 (as indicated by the win-loss record in the "Record" column), which is well above the statement's claim of only losing three games in the entire season. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
695	Refuted. According to rows 3 and 4 of the table, the Boston Celtics played against the New York Knicks twice during the 1984-85 season and won both times. Therefore, the statement "the New York Knicks did not win a game against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-85 season" is incorrect.
696	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics played more than 8 games at the Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season. There are a total of 46 games listed in the table, and several of them explicitly state that the location was the Boston Garden (games 34, 36, 37, 41, 43, and 44). Therefore, the statement that the Boston Celtics only played eight games at the Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season is false.
697	Supported. According to row 14 of the table, the Boston Celtics scored 131 points against the Detroit Pistons, which was the highest score they achieved in the 1984-85 season. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics achieved their highest score against the Detroit Pistons in the 1984-85 season" is supported by the table.
698	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, the Boston Celtics played the Chicago Bulls in Game 36 on January 9, 1985, and the location of the game was the Boston Garden.

699	Refuted. According to the "record" column in the table, the Boston Celtics had a record of 37 - 9 after the game on January 30th, 1985 (row 15). This indicates that they won more games than they lost in the 1984 - 1985 season. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics lost more games than they won in the 1984 - 1985 season" is not true.
700	Refuted. According to rows 3 and 4 of the table, the Boston Celtics won both games played against the New York Knicks during the 1984-1985 season, one on the road and one at home. Therefore, the statement that the New York Knicks won all home games played against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-1985 season is incorrect.
701	Refuted. According to the table, out of the first 46 games listed in the 1984-85 season, 26 were played in the Boston Garden (rows 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15). Since 26 is more than half of 46, the statement that less than half the 1984-1985 season games were played in the Boston Garden is incorrect.
702	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics' lowest-scoring game is not against the Philadelphia 76ers. The lowest-scoring game listed is against the Indiana Pacers on January 18th, where they scored only 86 points compared to the Pacers' 91 points. Therefore, the statement that the Boston Celtics achieved their lowest scoring game against the Philadelphia 76ers is incorrect.
703	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics lost to the Seattle Supersonics (game 42) and the Philadelphia 76ers (game 46) in Boston Garden. Therefore, the statement that "the Chicago Bulls were the only team to play the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden and win" is incorrect.
704	Refuted. According to the table, all of the players listed have a nationality listed, and only five of the nine players listed have a nationality of "United States". Therefore, the statement "the Utah Jazz had six players from the United States" is not supported by the table.
705	Refuted. According to the table, Georgia and Penn State are the schools/club teams associated with two different players in different positions (Shandon Anderson - Guard/Forward from Georgia; John Amaechi - Center/Forward from Penn State).  Therefore, the statement "of the three different positions Georgia and Penn State contributed two of the same" is false.
706	Supported. According to the table, after 2000, the following countries each contributed one player to the Utah Jazz all-time roster: England (John Amaechi), the United States (Louis Amundson), Brazil (Rafael Araújo), and Puerto Rico (Carlos Arroyo). Therefore, the statement "after 2000, England, the United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico each contributed one player" is supported by the table.
707	Supported. According to the table, eight out of the nine players listed have the nationality of the United States, while only one player listed has a nationality other than the United States. Therefore, the statement "the United States contributed the most players of all the countries" is supported by the table.

The table shows nine American players listed after 1985, with Louis Amundson being the most recent among them. Therefore, the statement that "after 1985, the United States contributed four players with Louis Amundson being the most recent" is incorrect.
709	Refuted. According to the table, the Utah Jazz had more than three players from the United States. All 10 rows of the table have U.S. players listed as their nationality. Therefore, the statement that the Utah Jazz had three players from the United States is incorrect.
710	Refuted. While both Georgia (Shandon Anderson) and Penn State (John Amaechi) contributed to the Utah Jazz roster with a player who had a different position, Anderson played as a guard-forward and Amaechi played as a center-forward, which means that both schools contributed to different positions and not a center and a guard as stated in the statement.
711	Supported. According to the table, after the year 2000, only Brazil and England contributed one player each to the Utah Jazz. Rafael Araújo from Brazil played for the Jazz in 2006-2007, and John Amaechi from England played for the team in 2001-2003. Therefore, the statement "after 2000, only Brazil and England contributed one player to the Utah Jazz" is supported by the table.
712	Refuted. According to the table, the United States contributed the most players to the Utah Jazz all-time roster, with eight out of the nine players listed being American. England contributed only one player, John Amaechi. Therefore, the statement that England contributed the most players of all the countries is not supported by the table and is, in fact, refuted by it.
713	Supported. According to the table, Rafael Araujo is the most recent player from the United States to be added to the Utah Jazz all-time roster, and he played for the team from 2006-2007. The latest U.S. player before him was J.J. Anderson, who played for the team from 1982-1985.

According to the table, the first episode titled "omae ga hosii" was broadcasted on May 10, 2010 and the second episode titled "arienai kisu" was broadcasted a week later on May 17, 2010.

716	Refuted. According to the table, the fifth episode titled "Suki to Ietara Iinoni" was broadcast on June 7, 2010, which is the most recent broadcast date among all the episodes. Therefore, the statement that it had the 2nd most recent broadcast date is incorrect.

722	Refuted. According to the table, the episode with the highest ratings is "omae ga hosii" with a rating of 22.4%. The episode "fukusyū no puropōzu" had a lower rating of 15.6%.

Therefore, the statement "Olga Govortsova has never reached the finals in a grand slam tournament" is supported by the table.
745	Refuted. According to the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the fourth round at the 2012 Australian Open, which is further than the third round. Therefore, the statement that the furthest she has ever advanced in a Grand Slam tournament is the third round is incorrect.
746	Refuted. The information in the table does not support the statement that Olga Govortsova won at least one Grand Slam tournament match in any given year from 2007-2011. She lost in the first round of the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open in 2007, and lost in the first round of all four Grand Slam tournaments in 2008. Although she did win matches in some Grand Slam tournaments in later years (e.g., third round at French Open in 2008), the table does not confirm that she won at least one Grand Slam match each year from 2007-2011.
747	Refuted. The year-end ranking for Olga Govortsova did not remain the same throughout the years between 2007 to 2011. She was ranked 49 in both 2007 and 2008, 52 in 2009, 74 in 2010, and 114 in 2011. Therefore, the statement that her ranking has never gone up during those years is incorrect.
748	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round of the French Open in both 2008 and 2009. Therefore, the statement "Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open two years in a row" is supported by the table.
749	Refuted. According to the table, Olga Govortsova did not reach the finals in any of the Grand Slam tournaments from 2007 to 2011; her best performance was reaching the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009. Therefore, the statement "Olga Govortsova reached the finals in a Grand Slam tournament" is refuted by the table.
750	Refuted. According to the table, Olga Govortsova has reached the third round in both the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Therefore, the statement that the furthest she has ever advanced in a Grand Slam tournament is the second round is incorrect.
751	Refuted. According to the table, Olga Govortsova has not won at least five Grand Slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007-2011. Although she reached the third round in two French Open tournaments and won two matches in both Wimbledon and the US Open in 2007, she never won more than two matches in any other Grand Slam tournament during this time period.
752	Refuted. According to row 23 of the table, Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking decreased from 2007 to 2011. In 2007, her year-end ranking was 49, and it remained the same in 2008. However, in 2009, her ranking dropped to 52, and in 2010 and 2011, it further dropped to 74 and 114, respectively. Therefore, the statement that her WTA year-end ranking has always gone up from 2007 to 2011 is not supported by the table.
753	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009, but in 2010 and 2011, she only reached the second round. Therefore, the statement that she advanced to the third round in the French Open five years in a row is incorrect.
754	Refuted. According to row 10 of the table, Tim Lajcik had one match end in a draw, but not all of his matches. Therefore, the statement "only one match resulted in the result of a draw" is incorrect.
755	Supported. According to the table, Tim Lajcik had 7 wins, 6 losses, and 1 draw. Therefore, there were more win results than loss results.
756	Supported. According to the table, only two matches went to the third round, as indicated by the number in the "round" column being 3. Therefore, the statement that "only two matches were played through three rounds" is supported by the table.
757	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, Tim Lajcik won the match against Joe Campanella in just 18 seconds, which is the shortest time recorded in the table among all of his matches. Therefore, the statement "the match with the shortest time was won against Joe Campanella" is supported by the table.
758	Supported. According to row 13 of the table, Tim Lajcik won the match against Eugene Jackson, which lasted for 9 minutes and 49 seconds, making it the match with the longest time in the table. Therefore, the statement "the match with the longest time was won against Eugene Jackson" is supported by the table.
759	Supported. According to row 10 of the table, one of Tim Lajcik's fights ended in a draw against Ron Waterman at UFC 22. Therefore, the statement that two of his matches resulted in a draw is supported by the table.
760	Refuted. According to the table, Tim Lajcik has ten wins (rows 4, 5, and 8-14) and six losses (rows 2-3 and 6-7, 9-11). Therefore, there were actually more win results than loss results, refuting the statement that there were fewer win results.
761	Supported. According to the table, there are three matches that went through three rounds, which are: row 4 (win against Osami Shibuya), row 10 (draw against Ron Waterman), and row 11 (loss against Tsuyoshi Kohsaka). Therefore, the statement "more than two matches were played through three rounds" is supported by the table.
762	Unsupported. There is no information in the table about the length of the matches, making it impossible to determine which match Tim Lajcik won in the shortest amount of time.
763	Refuted. The match with the longest time in the table is row 12, where Tim Lajcik won against Mark Tullius after 6:58 of the first round. Therefore, the statement that the match with the longest time was won against David Ross is incorrect.
764	Refuted. Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer in 11 out of the 13 games played in November (games 3-13) according to the "high points" column in the table, not 12 as stated in the statement. Moreover, the statement doesn't provide information about the last game played in the month of November (game 16) where Carmelo Anthony again was the leading scorer.
765	Refuted. The table only provides information about the first 16 games of the 2009-10 Denver Nuggets season, and it includes six games that were played in the Pepsi Center (rows 2, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14). Among those six games, the Nuggets won five (rows 2, 8, 9, 11, and 14) and lost one (row 12), which means they did not win all six games played at the Pepsi Center during this span. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
766	Supported. According to the table, the attendance of all the games played at the Pepsi Center during the 2009-10 Denver Nuggets season was over 15,000. For example, the attendance for the game against the Grizzlies was 15,823, the attendance for the game against the Lakers was 19,141, and the attendance for the game against the Knicks was 19,155. Therefore, the statement "attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center was over 15,000" is supported by the table.
767	Supported. According to the table, Denver won and lost games alternately throughout November, without losing more than one game in a row. They won the first three games, lost the fourth, won the fifth, lost the sixth, won the seventh, lost the eighth, won the ninth, won the tenth, won the eleventh and twelfth, and did not lose more than one game in a row. Therefore, the statement that they did not lose more than one game in a row during November is supported by the table.
768	Partially supported. According to the table, Chauncey Billups led or tied for the lead in assists for 6 out of the 13 games (games 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11). Therefore, the statement that he led or was tied for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games is not supported by the table.
769	Supported. According to the table, Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer on the Nuggets in 10 out of the 13 games played in November. Therefore, the statement "Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer on the Nuggets for 10 out of the 13 games played in November" is supported by the table.
770	Refuted. According to the table, the Denver Nuggets won six games played at the Pepsi Center during this period, as evident from row 2, row 3, row 4, row 8, row 9, and row 11. Therefore, the statement that the Nuggets lost all six games played at the Pepsi Center is incorrect.
771	Refuted. According to the table, the attendance for the games at the Pepsi Center ranged from 15,319 to 19,355. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that the attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center was over 19,000.
772	Refuted. According to the table, the Denver Nuggets did not lose more than one game in a row during November. They lost a game and then won one or more games before losing another. Therefore, the statement that they lost more than one game in a row on two occasions during November is incorrect based on the given table.
773	Refuted. According to the table, Ty Lawson led or was tied for the lead in assists for 5 out of the 13 games. Therefore, the statement "Ty Lawson led or was tied for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games" is not supported by the table.
774	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, the attendance for the game against Washington was 12376, which is the lowest attendance figure for any game listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "the lowest attendance figure for a game was 12376" is supported by the table.
775	The table does not provide enough information to support or refute the statement. To determine whether Stephen Jackson led the team in points for the most number of games in the 2009-10 Charlotte Bobcats season, we would need to see the entire season's worth of game data.
776	Supported. According to the table, Nazr Mohammed of the Charlotte Bobcats had 20 rebounds in the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on February 10th, 2010. Therefore, the statement that "the most rebounds by a Bobcats player in one game was 20" is supported by the table.
777	Supported. According to row 2, 4, 5, and 11 of the table, Raymond Felton led the Charlotte Bobcats in assists in four different games. Therefore, the statement "Raymond Felton led the team in assists 4 different times" is supported by the table.
778	Refuted. According to the "record" column in the table, the Charlotte Bobcats had a record of 27 wins and 29 losses during the 2009-10 season. Therefore, the statement that the Bobcats had a record of 3 wins and 7 losses is incorrect.
779	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, the attendance for the game against Washington on February 9 was 12376 which is the second lowest attendance figure for a game in the 2009-10 Charlotte Bobcats season. Therefore, the statement "the second lowest attendance figure for a game was 12376" is supported by the table.
780	Refuted. According to the table, out of the 10 games listed, Stephen Jackson led the team in points in 6 out of them. Therefore, he led the team in points for more than half the games in the table. The statement that he led the team in points for less than half the games is incorrect.
781	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, Nazr Mohammed had 20 rebounds in the game against Minnesota Timberwolves on February 10th, 2010. This is the second-highest number of rebounds by a Charlotte Bobcats player in one game, as mentioned in the statement.
782	Refuted. According to the table, Raymond Felton led the team in assists in four of the games listed (February 1, February 6, February 19, and February 22), meaning he did achieve a team-high in assists in less than four different games. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
783	Refuted. According to the table, the Charlotte bobcats had a record of 27 wins and 29 losses during the 2009-2010 season. Therefore, the statement that "the Bobcats had a record of more wins than losses" is false.
784	Supported. According to the table, in the 2007 season, the Dundee Hurricanes won 90% of their games (9 wins out of 10) in the BAFL Division 2 North, which helped them secure a position in the BAFL Division 1 North since they finished in 1st place in the division. Therefore, the statement that "the hurricanes won 90% of their games in 2007 which got them promoted to a higher division" is supported by the table.
785	Supported. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes had a losing record in the 2006 season with a record of 3 wins and 4 losses. They also had a losing record in the 2009 season with a record of 2 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie.

786	Supported. According to the table, the highest number of ties in a season by the Dundee Hurricanes was in 2008, where they achieved 3 ties. Therefore, the statement that "the highest number of ties in a season by the Hurricanes was in 2008" is supported by the table.
787	Refuted. According to row 2 and row 3 of the table, the number of wins for Dundee Hurricanes in 2003 was 6, and in 2004 it was also 6, which seems to support the statement. However, it should be noted that their final positions were different, with 4/11 in 2003 and 1/3 in 2004. Therefore, the statement that they won the same number of games in 2003 and 2004 is incomplete and somewhat misleading.
788	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, the Dundee Hurricanes ended their 2009 season with a final position of 5/7, which is their lowest final position compared to their other seasons listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "the 2009 Hurricanes season resulted in the lowest final position" is supported by the table.
789	Refuted. The Hurricanes won 90% of their games in 2007, according to row 6 of the table. They won 9 out of 10 games played that season. Also, they were promoted to Division 1 North. Therefore, the statement "the hurricanes only won 50% of their games in 2007 and did not get promoted to a higher division" is refuted by the table.
790	Refuted. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes had a losing season in three out of the seven seasons listed: 2003, 2005, and 2009. They had winning or tied seasons in the other four seasons (2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008). Therefore, the statement that the Dundee Hurricanes had four losing seasons (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) is incorrect.
791	Refuted. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes' highest number of ties in a season was one, and it occurred during the 2004 season. Therefore, the statement "the highest number of ties in a season by the hurricanes was in 2003" is refuted by the table.
792	Supported. According to row 2-8 of the table, the Dundee Hurricanes did not win the same number of games in any of the seasons they played between 2003 and 2009. Therefore, the statement "the Dundee Hurricanes did not win the same number of games in any of the seasons they played between 2003 and 2009" is supported by the table.
793	Refuted. According to the table, at least five of the projects listed have been completed. Rows 5 and 6 show that the Flowood site and the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals site were fully deleted, indicating that the cleanup was completed. Row 10 shows that cleanup was completed for the Walcott Chemical Co Warehouses site before the formal creation of NPL (National Priorities List) followed by a deletion on the same day. Therefore, the statement that only three of the projects have been completed so far is incorrect.
794	Supported. According to the table, there are two projects (chemfax, inc and Potter Co) that were proposed but were never listed. Since these projects were never listed, they were never completed, which indicates that the statement "two of the projects were proposed, but never listed and never completed" is supported by the table.
795	Supported. According to row 5 and row 9, both the Flowood site and Sonford Products sites are in Rankin County. Therefore, the statement that there were two projects in Rankin County, Sonford Products and Flowood Site, is supported by the table.
796	Supported. According to the table, the Potter Co in Copiah was proposed on May 10, 1993, but has not been listed as a Superfund site. Therefore, the statement that "the first project proposed was Potter Co in Copiah, but it has not yet been listed" is supported by the table.
797	Refuted. According to the table, the construction for the Flowood site was completed on September 17, 1993, and the construction for the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals project was completed on August 8, 1997. Therefore, the statement is incorrect as the construction was completed in different years for each project, not in 1993 for both projects.
798	Refuted. The table indicates that only two of the projects were completed between 1993-1997: the Flowood site and the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. site. The Potter Co site was proposed for listing in 1993 but was neither listed nor completed as of the last update in the table. Therefore, not all three of the completed projects were completed between 1993-1997.
799	Partially supported. According to the table, there is only one project listed during 1993, which is the Chemfax Inc. site in Harrison County. However, the table does not provide information on whether the site was completed or not. Additionally, there is another site listed, the Potter Co site in Copiah County, that was proposed in 1993 but does not have any information on whether it was completed or not. Therefore, the statement that "two of the projects were proposed and listed during 1993, but were never completed" is partially supported as there is no information available on whether the Chemfax Inc site was completed or not, but there is one site (not two) that was proposed in 1993 and not completed according to this table.
800	Supported. According to the table, the Flowood site and Sonford Products, both located in Rankin County, were proposed and listed for inclusion in the Superfund program. Therefore, the statement that "Rankin County was home to multiple projects that were proposed and listed" is supported by the table.
801	Refuted. According to the table, the Potter Co site was proposed on May 10, 1993, but there is no listing date provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot compare the proposed and listed dates of the site to determine if it was the last to be listed.
802	Partially refuted. According to the table, construction at the Flowood site was completed on September 17, 1993, while construction at the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc site was completed on August 8, 1997. Therefore, the statement that construction was completed during the same time frame of 1993 is incorrect. However, both sites were constructed during the 1990s, if that is what the statement is referring to as the time frame.
803	Supported. According to the table, there were 13 tour matches played by the New Zealand rugby union team in the last 3 months of 1978.

806	Supported. According to row 5 and row 13 of the table, there was a tour match held on October 28, 1978, and a test match held on November 25, 1978, both at Twickenham in London. Therefore, the statement that there was a tour match held in October and a test match held in November in Twickenham, London, is supported by the table.
807	Supported. According to the table, there were a total of five matches played during the month of October 1978. The matches held during that month are as follows:- Cambridge University on October 18- Cardiff on October 21- West Wales XV on October 25- London Counties on October 28- Munster on October 31Therefore, the statement that "there were 5 matches held in October of 1978" is supported by the table.

809	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the New Zealand team scored 12 points against Cambridge University in the tour match played on October 18th, 1978. No opposing team scored more than 10 points against Cambridge University in the matches played during the tour, as per the provided table.
810	Refuted. According to the table, there was only one match played by the New Zealand rugby team in November, which was a test match against England held on November 25, 1978, at Twickenham in London. Therefore, the statement that "all matches held in November in Twickenham, London were tour matches" is contradicted by the fact that one of the matches was a test match against England.
811	Refuted. According to the table, there were four matches held in October 1978 and only one match took place after 25th of the month, which was on 28th October. Therefore the statement that "all 5 matches held in October of 1978 took place after the 25th of the month" is incorrect.
812	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Mets on September 1st, and the final score was 3-0, which means that they won the game. However, the attendance for this game was not 19196, as specified in the statement. The attendance was 24792, which does not match the statement provided.
813	Refuted. According to row 22 of the table, the game against the Yankees on September 22nd resulted in a loss of 8-1, not a win. Also, the attendance for that game was 23,380, not 3,380. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.

817	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Mets on September 1, and the combined score of the game was 3-0, which is the lowest score of any game that month.

818	Supported. According to row 28 of the table, the Blue Jays' record after the game on September 28 was 76-86, and they indeed lost that game to the Red Sox. Therefore, the statement that "the blue jays fell to 76-86 following their loss to the red sox on september 28" is supported by the table.

821	Refuted. According to the table, the swing to gain for Dundee West was 2.13 and the swing to gain for Western Isles was 2.91. Therefore, the statement "Dundee West has lower swing to gain points than Western Isles" is untrue.
822	Refuted. According to the table, the constituencies of Kilmarnock & Loudoun, Dundee West, Western Isles, Glasgow Govan all had the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 3rd place in the 2003 election, while the rest had the SNP in 2nd place or did not contest in the previous election. Therefore, the statement "all of the constituency has 2nd SNP's place 2003" is not supported by the table.
823	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Galloway & Upper Nithsdale's winning party in 2003 was the Conservative Party, while according to row 11, Paisley South's winning party in 2003 was the Labour Party. Therefore, the statement "Galloway & Upper Nithsdal winning party 2003 is conservative while that of Paisley South is labour" is supported by the table.
824	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, the result for Glasgow Govan constituency is "SNP gain," which means that the Scottish National Party (SNP) won the seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament General Election.

825	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the swing to gain for Galloway & Upper Nithsdale constituency was 0.17, which is the lowest swing to gain points in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007.

826	Supported. According to the table, the swing to gain points for Dundee West is 2.13, while for Western Isles it is 2.91. Therefore, the statement "Dundee West has higher swing to gain points than Western Isles" is supported by the table.
827	Refuted. According to the table, the winning party for each constituency is given in column 3, and the SNP's place in the 2003 election is given in column 4. The statement "all of the constituency has 3rd SNP's place 2003" is incorrect because, from the given data, we can see that the SNP placed second in all constituencies except for the one listed in row 1 (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale), where they placed third.
828	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, the winning party of Galloway & Upper Nithsdale in 2003 was the Conservative party, not the Liberal Democrats.

829	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, Glasgow Govan is one of the constituencies where the result in 2007 was an SNP gain. Therefore, the statement that "Glasgow Govan is one of the five constituencies with a result as an SNP gain" is supported by the table.
830	Refuted. According to the table, 0.17 is the swing to gain points for the constituency of Galloway & Upper Nithsdale, but that is not the highest swing to gain points in the entire election. The swing to gain points for other constituencies (such as Kilmarnock & Loudoun with 1.92 and Dundee West with 2.13) is higher than 0.17, meaning the statement that "0.17 is the highest swing to gain points in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007" is not supported by the table.
831	Supported. According to the table, Steve Stricker had a score of 139, which is one stroke lower than Phil Mickelson's score of 143. Therefore, the statement "Steve Stricker had a score lower than Phil Mickelson" is supported by the table.
832	Refuted. According to row 9 of the table, Graeme McDowell, not Pádraig Harrington, is the player representing Northern Ireland in the 2006 U.S. Open. Therefore, the statement "Pádraig Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland" is refuted by the table.

834	Supported. According to the table, Steve Stricker from the United States scored 70+69=139, which was the best score among all players in the tournament. Therefore, the statement "Steve Stricker has the best score out of all the players from the United States" is supported by the table.
835	Supported. According to the table, there are five players who are from the United States, which are Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Jason Dufner, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser. Therefore, the statement "there are 5 players that are from the United States" is supported by the table.
836	Refuted. Steve Stricker is a golfer from the United States, not Scotland as implied in the statement. However, the rest of the statement is also incorrect because Steve Stricker's score of 139 was indeed lower than Phil Mickelson's score of 143, which means Stricker had a better score than Mickelson in the tournament.
837	Supported. According to row 9 of the table, Graeme McDowell is listed as being from Northern Ireland, and according to row 7 of the table, Pádraig Harrington is listed as being from Ireland. Since Northern Ireland is a separate country from the Republic of Ireland, it can be said that Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell are both from Northern Ireland.
838	Supported. According to row 4 and row 5 of the table, Kenneth Ferrie of England and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia both scored a +1 to par, making them the only players in the tournament to achieve that score. Therefore, the statement "Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia were the only players to score a +1 to par" is supported by the table.
839	Supported. According to the table, Steve Stricker of the United States had the lowest score of 70+69=139, which is one stroke under the par of the course and the lowest score among all players. Therefore, the statement "Steve Stricker of the United States has the lowest score among all the players" is supported by the table.
840	Refuted. According to the table, there are two players from England and four players from the United States who played in the 2nd round. Therefore, there were more players from the United States than from England during the event in the 2nd round, and the statement that there were more players from England is incorrect.
841	Supported. According to the table, the crowd at the Princes Park venue was 23,830 (row 5) while the crowd at the Junction Oval was 16,249 (row 6). Therefore, the statement that "the Princes Park venue had more crowd than the Junction Oval venue" is supported by the table.
842	Refuted. According to the table, North Melbourne scored 121 points in their match against St Kilda, which is not the highest score for an away team. Hawthorn scored 138 points in their match against Collingwood, making them the away team with the highest score. Therefore, the statement "North Melbourne had the highest score out of all the away teams" is refuted.
843	Supported. According to the table, Fitzroy scored 97 points (15.7) and Footscray scored 89 points (13.11) in their respective matches. Therefore, the statement that Fitzroy has a higher score than Footscray is supported by the table.
844	Supported. According to the table, all the matches were played on June 7, 1975 (the date is mentioned in each row). Therefore, the statement "all the matches were on the same date" is supported by the table.
845	Refuted. According to the table, the game at Kardinia Park between Geelong and Melbourne had a crowd of 13,328, while the game at Moorabbin Oval between St Kilda and North Melbourne had a crowd of 17,811. Therefore, the statement "Kardinia Park has less crowd than Moorabbin Oval" is not supported by the table.
846	Refuted. According to the table, the crowd at Princes Park was 23,830, while at the Junction Oval, the crowd was 16,249. Therefore, the statement that "the Princes Park venue had just as much crowd as the Junction Oval venue" is not supported by the table.
847	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, North Melbourne scored 17.19 (121) points, which is the second-highest score achieved by any away team in the listed matches.
848	Refuted. According to the table, Fitzroy scored 15.7 (97) in their match against Carlton, which is not the highest score compared to the other teams. Hawthorn had a higher score of 19.24 (138) in their match against Collingwood. Therefore, the statement "Fitzroy has a higher score than any of the other teams" is refuted by the table.
849	Refuted. According to the table, all matches took place on the same date, which was 7 June 1975. Therefore, the statement that "all of the matches were on different dates" is incorrect.
850	Refuted. According to the table, the crowd at Moorabbin Oval was 17,811, while the crowd at Kardinia Park was 13,328, which means that the statement "Moorabbin oval has less crowd than Kardinia Park" is not supported by the table.
851	Refuted. According to the table, Shane Hall ran a total of 198 races between 1995 and 2008, not 190. Therefore, the statement that Shane Hall ran a total of 190 races between the years of 1995-2008 is incorrect.
852	Supported. To find the average finish for Shane Hall's career between 1995-2008, we can add up all his finishes from that time period and divide by the total number of races he participated in during that time. According to the table, the sum of all his finishes between 1995-2008 is 477.5 (24.0+26.4+27.1+24.9+25.8+35.0+27.9+27.0+35.8+31.4+40.9+38.9+43.0). Dividing 477.5 by the total number of races he participated in during that time (191 races), we get an average finish of 31.39. Therefore, the statement "Shane Hall had an average finish of 31.39 between 1995-2008" is supported by the table.
853	Supported. According to the table, Shane Hall ran a total of 75 races during the 1995 and 1996 seasons for the Stegell Motorsports team, whereas he ran 28, 31, 0, 2, 33, 24, 5, 9, 7, and 1 races for other teams. Therefore, the statement that he ran more races on the Stegell Motorsports team than on any other team is supported by the table.
854	Supported. According to the table, Shane Hall had one top 5 finish and nine top 10 finishes throughout his racing career. Therefore, he had more top 10 placements than top 5 placements, and the statement is supported by the table.
855	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, in the year 2000, Shane Hall participated in 2 races and had 1 DNF, which is half of his total races for that year. Therefore, the statement "in the year 2000 shane hall DNF half of his races" is supported by the table.
856	Refuted. According to the table, the total number of races Shane Hall ran between the years of 1996-2008 is 193 (summing up the "races" column). Therefore, the statement that Hall ran a total of 198 races between those years is incorrect.
857	Supported. To find the average finish of Shane Hall between 1995-2008, we need to calculate the total finish points (adding up the finish positions for each year) and divide it by the number of races he participated in during that time period. From the table, we can see that he participated in 157 races between 1995-2008 (adding up the "races" column for those years). The total finish points can be calculated by adding up the "finish" column for those years, which comes out to be 4691.8 (i.e., 24.0 + 26.4 + 27.1 + 24.9 + 25.8 + 35.0 + 27.9 + 27.0 + 35.8 + 31.4 + 40.9 + 38.9 + 43.0). Therefore, his average finish would be 4691.8/157 = 29.84, which rounds off to 33.39. Hence, the statement "Shane Hall had an average finish of 33.39 between 1995-2008" is supported by the table.
858	Refuted. According to the table, Shane Hall ran only 57 races with Hensley Racing, which is fewer than the 62 races he ran with Stegell Motorsports. Therefore, the statement that he ran more races on the Hensley Racing team than on any of his other teams is not supported by the table.
859	Refuted. According to the table, Shane Hall placed in the top 10 on more occasions than he placed in the top 5. He had one top 5 finish and six top 10 finishes. Therefore, the statement "Shane Hall had placed top 5 more than he placed top 10" is refuted by the table.
860	Refuted. According to row 8 of the table, Shane Hall had six DNFs out of 33 races in the year 2001, which is not half of his races. Therefore, the statement "in the year 2001 Shane Hall had DNF half his races" is not true.
861	Supported. According to the table, the apparent magnitude of the two irregular galaxies listed (NGC 5408 and NGC 5477) are 14.0 and 14.5, respectively. The apparent magnitude of the two spiral galaxies listed (NGC 5457 and NGC 5474) are 8.7 and 11.9, respectively. Therefore, the irregular galaxies have on average 2.1 more apparent magnitude than the spiral galaxies, which supports the statement.
862	Refuted. According to the table, spiral galaxy NGC 5457 in Ursa Major has an apparent magnitude of 8.7, which is lower (i.e., brighter) than the apparent magnitude of the other galaxies listed. Therefore, the statement that spiral galaxies have the least apparent magnitude is not supported by the table.
863	Refuted. There is only one galaxy categorized as an irregular galaxy in the table, which is NGC 5408 in the constellation Centaurus. Therefore, the statement that "irregular galaxy has two NGC numbers in the list" is incorrect.
864	Refuted. According to the table, the Globular Cluster (NGC 5466) has an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and the Irregular Galaxy (NGC 5408) has an apparent magnitude of 14.0. Therefore, the statement "globular cluster has less apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy" is false, as the globular cluster has a smaller apparent magnitude (i.e., it is brighter) than the irregular galaxy.
865	Refuted. According to the table, NGC 5408 (an irregular galaxy in Centaurus) has the highest declination (degree22′44″) followed by NGC 5457 (a spiral galaxy in Ursa Major) with a declination of degree20′53″. NGC 5466, the globular cluster in Boötes mentioned in the statement, has a declination of degree32′04″, which is not the second highest in the list. Therefore, the statement that the globular cluster has the second highest declination (j2000) in the list is refuted.
866	Refuted. There is no "globular galaxy" listed in the table. The closest match is "globular cluster", which has an apparent magnitude of 10.5. The irregular galaxy listed in the table has an apparent magnitude of 14.0. Therefore, the statement that "irregular galaxy is the object type having 2.1 more apparent magnitude than globular galaxy" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
867	Refuted. According to the table, spiral galaxies do not have the most apparent magnitude. NGC 5457, a spiral galaxy, has an apparent magnitude of 8.7, but there is another object in the table, NGC 5408, an irregular galaxy, which has a higher apparent magnitude of 14.0. Therefore, the statement that spiral galaxies have the most apparent magnitude is not supported by the table.
868	Supported. According to the table, there are two spiral galaxies in the list and they have the NGC numbers 5457 and 5474. Therefore, the statement "spiral galaxy has two NGC numbers in the list" is supported by the table.
869	Refuted. According to the table, the globular cluster (NGC 5466) has an apparent magnitude of 10.5, while the irregular galaxy (NGC 5408) has an apparent magnitude of 14.0. Therefore the statement that "globular cluster has more apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy" is incorrect.
870	Refuted. According to the table, the object with the second-highest declination ( j2000 ) in the list is the irregular galaxy with NGC number 5477 located in Ursa Major constellation with a declination of degree27′40″. Therefore, the statement "spiral galaxy has the second highest declination ( j2000 ) in the list" is incorrect.
871	Supported. According to the table, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) hosted a match on 3rd June 1961 between Melbourne and Carlton, and the recorded crowd attendance was 49,678, which is the highest attendance among all the matches in the table. Therefore, the statement "during the 1961 VFL season, MCG venue recorded the highest crowd participation" is supported by the table.
872	Supported. According to the table, Kardinia Park was used as a venue for the match between Geelong and Footscray on June 3, 1961. Therefore, Kardinia Park is one of the six venues which were put to use on that day, supporting the statement.
873	Supported. According to the table, North Melbourne recorded a home score of 9.14 (68) against St Kilda, and South Melbourne recorded a home score of 7.8 (50) against Fitzroy. Therefore, the statement "North Melbourne home team recorded a home score of 9.14 (68) while South Melbourne recorded a home score of 7.8 (50)" is supported by the table.
874	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, the game between South Melbourne and Fitzroy, held at Lake Oval, recorded a crowd attendance of 14,500. In contrast, according to row 3 of the table, the game between Hawthorn and Richmond, held at Glenferrie Oval, recorded a crowd attendance of 15,000. Therefore, the statement that "Lake Oval venue recorded a lower crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue" is supported by the table.
875	Supported. According to the table, the crowd at Glenferrie Oval for the Hawthorn vs Richmond match was 15,000 while the crowd at Arden Street Oval for the North Melbourne vs St Kilda match was 13,000. Therefore, the statement "Glenferrie Oval venue recorded 2000 more crowd participants than that of the Arden Street Oval venue" is supported by the table.
876	Refuted. According to the table, the highest participation of the crowd during the 1961 VFL season was recorded in the match between Melbourne and Carlton held at the MCG, which had a crowd of 49,678. Therefore, the statement that "during the 1961 VFL season, Lake Oval venue recorded the highest crowd participation" is not supported by the table.
877	Supported. According to the table, Kardinia Park was one of the venues used on 3 June 1961, along with Arden Street Oval, Glenferrie Oval, and Lake Oval. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
878	Refuted. According to the table, North Melbourne and South Melbourne are two different teams who played different matches on the same day. North Melbourne played against St Kilda and recorded a score of 9.14 (68) as a home team while South Melbourne played against Fitzroy and recorded a score of 7.8 (50) as a home team. Therefore, the statement that "North Melbourne home team recorded an home score of 7.8 (50) while South Melbourne recorded an home score of 9.14 (68)" is incorrect because it confuses the home team and the score of two different matches played by two different teams.
879	Supported. According to the table, the crowd attendance at the Lake Oval (14,500) where South Melbourne played Fitzroy was higher than the crowd attendance at Glenferrie Oval (15,000) where Hawthorn played Richmond. Therefore, the statement "Lake Oval venue recorded a higher crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue" is supported by the table.
880	Refuted. According to the table, the game between North Melbourne and St Kilda at Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 13,000, while the game between Hawthorn and Richmond at Glenferrie Oval had a crowd of 15,000. Therefore, the statement "Glenferrie Oval venue recorded 5000 more crowd participants than that of the Arden Street Oval venue" is incorrect.
881	Refuted. The table lists four different highest ranks - ōzeki, sekiwake, ōzeki and ōzeki respectively for Kotonishiki, Hasegawa, Kotomitsuki, and Musōyama. Therefore, the statement "there are only two highest ranks listed in the table" is not supported by the table.
882	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, Takamiyama's first record was in November 1969 and his last record was in September 1982, which is a range of 13 years. Therefore, the statement "Takamiyama had the longest time range between his first and last record, 13 years" is supported by the table.
883	Partially supported. According to the table, the total of 22 appears three times in rows 11, 12, and 13. However, another total that appears more than twice is 30, which appears twice in rows 5 and 6. Therefore, the statement "the only total that appears more than two times is 22" is not accurate.
884	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, Hasegawa's total sumo record of 30 was recorded between November 1965 and September 1974. Therefore, the first record was recorded in November of the year 1965.
885	Refuted. There is no information in the table regarding the months when the highest and lowest records were recorded. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table alone.
886	Refuted. The table lists four highest ranks: ōzeki, sekiwake, yokozuna, and ōzeki (again). Therefore, the statement "there are only three highest ranks listed in the table" is incorrect.
887	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, Takamiyama had his first sumo record in November 1969 and had his last sumo record in September 1982, which is a time range of 13 years. Therefore, the statement that Takamiyama had the shortest time range between his first and last record, 13 years, is supported by the table.
888	Refuted. According to the table, the total of 30 appears twice for two different wrestlers (Kotomitsuki and Hasegawa) and the total of 27 also appears twice for two different wrestlers (Akinoshima and Takamiyama). Therefore, the statement that "the only total that appears more than two times is 31" is incorrect.
889	Refuted. According to the table, the first record was recorded for Hasegawa after November 1965, which means that there were records recorded before November 1965. Therefore, the statement "the first record was recorded after November 1965" is incorrect.
890	Refuted. The table does not provide information about the months in which the last records for the highest and lowest totalling names were recorded. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted based on the provided table alone.
891	Supported. Based on the table, equestrian events were held every four years at the Asian Games from 1982 to 2010, with the exception of the year 1990.
892	None
893	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Nadia Al-Moutawakel won the gold medal in equestrian at the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi. Therefore, the statement "Nadia Al-Moutawakel was the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games" is supported by the table.
894	Supported. According to the table, each year's gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been a different person. Therefore, the statement "the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year they have occurred" is supported by the table.
895	Refuted. According to the table, South Korea has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games only once, in Seoul in 1986. While South Korea has hosted the entire Asian Games multiple times (including in Busan in 2002 and Incheon in 2014), the equestrian events were not held at those locations. Therefore, the statement that South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time in Seoul and Doha is incorrect.
896	Supported. According to the table, Equestrian at the Asian Games occurred every four years from 1982 to 2010.
897	Refuted. According to the table, the statement is incorrect. The Equestrian at the Asian Games was held in Hiroshima, Japan in 1994 and Bangkok, Thailand in 1998. Therefore, it was held in different cities in those two years except for those two years.
898	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the 1982 Asian Games held in New Delhi. And, there is no mention of Nadia Al-Moutawaa winning a silver medal in the same year as her gold medal win. However, she won a silver medal in a different year. Therefore, the statement "Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and win silver another year" is supported by the table.
899	Supported. According to the table, the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year except 1994 and 1998. In 1994, Konoshin Kuwahara won the gold medal, and in 1998, Jin Kanno won the gold medal. Therefore, the statement "the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998" is supported by the table.
900	Refuted. According to the table, South Korea hosted equestrian at the Asian Games only once, in Seoul in 1986. Therefore, the statement that South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time, in Seoul two times is incorrect.

902	Supported. According to the table, the 49ers' first opponent of the 1947 season was the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the game was played on August 31, 1947, as listed in row 2. Therefore, the statement that "the 49ers first opponent of the season was the Brooklyn Dodgers" is supported by the table.
903	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the first game of the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season was played on August 31, 1947, against the Brooklyn Dodgers, and it resulted in a win for the 49ers (W). Therefore, the statement that August 31, 1947, was the date of the first game of the season is supported by the table.
904	Supported. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers tied two out of the fourteen games played during the 1947 season. Specifically, they tied with the Baltimore Colts with a score of 28-28 in Week 6, and they tied with the Buffalo Bills with a score of 21-21 in Week 14. Therefore, the statement "the 49ers tied two out of fourteen games in the 1947 season" is supported by the table.
905	Supported. According to rows 3 and 9 of the table, the San Francisco 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons twice in the 1947 season, winning 17-14 in week 2 and winning 26-16 in week 9. Therefore, the statement "the 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons two times in the 1947 season" is supported by the table.
906	Refuted. According to the table, the 49ers lost only four out of the 14 games in the 1947 season (against the New York Yankees, Cleveland Browns twice, and Chicago Rockets). Therefore, the statement that the 49ers lost eight of the games in the 1947 season is incorrect.
907	Supported. According to row 15 of the table, the last opponent of the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season was the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the game ended in a tie with a score of 21-21.

908	Refuted. According to the table, there are 14 games listed in the season, and the last game was played on December 7th, 1947. Therefore, the statement "August 31st, 1947 was the date of the last game of the season" is false.
909	Refuted. According to the table, the 49ers lost four out of their fourteen games in the 1947 season, as indicated by the "L" (for loss) in the "Result" column for weeks 4, 8, 10, and 11. Therefore, the statement that the 49ers lost only two out of fourteen games in the 1947 season is incorrect.
910	False. According to the table, the 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons twice in the 1947 season, once in Week 2 and once in Week 9. Therefore, the statement "the 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons one time in the 1947 season" is false.
911	Partially supported. According to the table, Annika Sörenstam won the Women's British Open in 2003 with a score of 278, which was -10 under par. This score was the lowest winning score during her championship year, but we cannot compare it to the other years from the table. Similarly, Yani Tseng won the Women's British Open in 2010 with a score of 277, which was -11 under par. Therefore, the statement "Annika Sörenstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest number of strokes" is partially supported for the years 2003 and 2010, respectively.
912	Refuted. According to the table, Yani Tseng finished as the runner-up in the 2008 Women's British Open but became the champion in 2010 only. Yani Tseng also won the 2011 championship, but she did not become the champion in 2011 after being a runner-up in 2008. Therefore, the statement "Yani Tseng was the runner up in 2008 and became the champion in 2010 and 2011" is incorrect.
913	Supported. According to row 14 of the table, Se Ri Pak from South Korea was the champion in the 2001 Women's British Open with a score of 277 (-11), and two years later in 2003, she finished runner-up with a score of 279 (-9), one stroke behind the winner, Annika Sörenstam. Therefore, the statement that "Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001, then came 2nd place two years after" is supported by the table.
914	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, Jiyai Shin from South Korea won the 2012 Women's British Open by nine strokes and Inbee Park was the runner-up. Therefore, the statement "Jiyal Shin became champion by beating Inbee Park in the 2012 Open with 9 strokes" is supported by the table.
915	Refuted. Although the table lists the purse and winner's share for both tournaments, the statement doesn't ask about the total amount each earned but rather the difference between their earnings. The table shows that Jiyai Shin won in 2012 and earned £428,650 in winner's share, while Yani Tseng was the runner-up in 2011 and earned £392,133. Therefore, Yani Tseng earned more in 2011 than Jiyai Shin did in 2012 (by £36,517).
916	Partially supported. According to the table, Annika Sörenstam and Catriona Matthew did indeed win the Women's British Open, but there is no mention of them having won with the lowest number of strokes. Knowing their winning scores but not the corresponding winning scores from other years and players does not allow us to draw a conclusion about whether they won with the lowest number of strokes.
917	Refuted. According to the table, Karrie Webb was the runner-up in 2008 Women's British Open, but she did not win the championship in either 2010 or 2011. Yani Tseng won the championship in both of those years.
918	Supported. According to row 14 of the table, Se Ri Pak from South Korea was the champion at the Women's British Open in 2001, and two years later, in 2003, she finished in 2nd place, one stroke behind the winner.
919	Incorrect. The statement is mixing up details from different years. Jiyai Shin from South Korea won the 2012 Women's British Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club with a score of 279 (-9) and 9-stroke lead over the runner-up Inbee Park. Therefore, Jiyai Shin won the tournament by 9 strokes, but it happened in 2012 and not in 2010, and she beat Inbee Park and not Yani Tseng. There is no mention of Jiyai Shin or Inbee Park in row 5, which describes the 2010 Women's British Open.
920	Refuted. The statement is comparing the earnings of Jiyai Shin and Yani Tseng in different years, which cannot be determined by the table. The table only provides information on the purse and the winner’s share of each year's tournament. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if Shin earned less than Tseng based on the table.
921	Supported. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins won 12 games and lost 4 games during the 1983 regular season. Therefore, the statement that "the Dolphins finished the regular season with a 12-4 record" is supported by the table.
922	Supported. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins recorded two shutouts during the season, winning 12-0 against the Buffalo Bills in Week 1 and 37-0 against the Baltimore Colts in Week 12. Therefore, the statement "the Dolphins' defense recorded two shutouts during the season" is supported by the table.
923	Refuted. Although the Miami Dolphins had a successful season in 1983 with 12 wins and 4 losses, the statement that "9 of the Dolphins' final 10 games were victories" is incorrect. From week 10 to week 13, they won four consecutive games. However, they lost their 11th game to the New England Patriots, and although they won the remaining 3 games of the season, their 10th game was not a win. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
924	No, the statement is incorrect. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins scored more than 38 points in three games: in week 1, they beat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 12-0 (scoring a total of 12 points); in week 2, they beat the New England Patriots by a score of 34-24 (scoring a total of 34 points); and in week 13 they beat the Cincinnati Bengals by a score of 38-14 (scoring a total of 38 points). Therefore, the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game was 38, which refutes the statement.
925	Supported. According to the table, the lowest attendance for a game during the 1983 Miami Dolphins season was 32,343, which was during the eighth week game against the Baltimore Colts. Therefore, the statement "the lowest attendance figure for a game was 32343" is supported by the table.
926	Supported. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins recorded three shutouts during the 1983 season, where they defeated the Buffalo Bills 12-0 in Week 1, the Baltimore Colts 37-0 in Week 12, and the New England Patriots 34-0 in the final game of the regular season. Therefore, the statement that "the Dolphins' defense recorded three shutouts during the 1983 season" is supported by the table.
927	Refuted. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins did not win all of their last 10 games. They lost to the Los Angeles Raiders in their third game of the season and lost to the Buffalo Bills in their 6th game of the season, which means they had two losses before their final 10 games. Therefore, the statement "the dolphins' final 10 games were victories" is false.
928	No, the statement is not accurate. From the given table, Miami Dolphins scored 38 points against both the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills (in the game they lost 38-35) during the 1983 NFL season. Therefore, the statement "the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game was 34 points" is refuted by the table.
929	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the Dolphins game against the Houston Oilers on December 4, 1983, was 39,434. This is the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins' game. Therefore, the statement "the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins' game was 39434" is supported by the table.
930	Refuted. According to the table, the score was not the same on February 27 and February 29. On February 27, the Minnesota Wild beat Tampa Bay Lightning 3-2, and on February 29, the Minnesota Wild beat Florida Panthers 3-2. While the scores for both games were the same (3-2 in favor of the Minnesota Wild), the statement specifically specifies the dates of February 27 and February 29, which were not the same in terms of score.
931	Supported. According to the table, the score on February 10 was Minnesota Wild (2) - St. Louis(1) and the score on February 24 was Calgary(2) - Minnesota Wild(1), which means both matches had scores of 2-1, as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score on February 10 and February 24 was 2-1" is supported by the table.
932	Refuted. According to the table, the match on February 12 was played against Edmonton, and the decision was Harding. However, the match on February 20 was played against Chicago, and the decision was also Harding, not the same as the match on February 12. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
933	Refuted. The table only shows a portion of the Minnesota Wild's schedule for the 2007-08 season and does not provide a complete picture of their home/away games for the entire season. Therefore, we can not conclude whether the statement is true or false based on this table.
934	Refuted. According to the table:- Backstrom was the decision 7 times (row 2,3,4,8,9,12,13).- Harding was the decision 4 times (row 6,10,11,15).Therefore, the difference between the number of times Backstrom and Harding were the decision is only 3, not eleven as claimed in the statement.
935	Refuted. According to the table, the Minnesota Wild won both games played on February 27 and February 29 during the 2007-08 season, against Tampa Bay and Florida respectively.

936	Refuted. According to the table, the scores for the Minnesota Wild's games on February 10 and February 24 are 2-1 and 2-1 respectively. Therefore, the statement that the difference in score between these two games was more than 2 is incorrect as the difference is zero.
937	Refuted. According to the table, the match on February 12 had a score of 2-4, whereas the match on February 20 had a score of 0-3. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the match on February 12 and February 20 both had the same score" is incorrect and refuted by the table.
938	Refuted. The table only shows a few games during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season and does not show the complete schedule. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the team played more games at home or away based on the given table.
939	Refuted. According to the table, during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision was Backstrom's 9 times (row 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14) and Harding's 5 times (row 6, 7, 10, 11, 15). Therefore, the statement "during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision was Harding more times than it was Backstrom" is false.

943	Supported.

In week 4, the Lions lost 24-14, and in week 8, the Lions won 27-6.

949	Refuted. According to the table, the Detroit Lions played two games against the Green Bay Packers (in weeks 4 and 8), and in both games, the Packers scored more than 6 points.

According to the table, Reasons to be Pretty was only nominated for Best Play at the 2009 Tony Award ceremony and did not receive any further nominations for this category in any other award ceremony. Therefore, the statement that Reasons to be Pretty was nominated for Best Play more than one time is refuted by the table.
1054	Refuted. The table shows that there were Drama Desk Award nominations for "Reasons to Be Pretty" in the year 2009, so the statement "before 2009 was the only year that reasons to be pretty had a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony" is incorrect.

1070	Unsupported. The table only provides information about the performances of golf players in the 2002 U.S. Open and does not provide information about the country of origin of the players, except for the ones mentioned in the table. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the table whether Nick Faldo was the only player from England.

1075	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, Tiger Woods' score was 205 which is mentioned under the column "Score" and his score relative To par was -5, which is mentioned under the column "To Par". Therefore, the statement "Tiger Woods score was less than 205" is incorrect.
1076	Refuted. According to row 10 of the table, Justin Leonard's score for the tournament was 73 + 71 + 68 = 212, which is equal to the score of Nick Faldo and also puts him in a tie for 8th place.

But the table does mention that he won $7,500 for finishing in that position.

Additionally, the total points of an opponent is not solely determined by their record, as points systems for leagues can vary. Therefore, the statement that "the Chicago Black Hawks are the only opponent with 63 points" is not supported by the table and is refuted.
1097	Supported. According to row 45 of the table, for the 2018 season, the Air Force-Navy score, as well as the Air Force-Army score, is yet to be determined (tbd). Therefore, the statement "for the 2018 season, the Air Force-Navy score is yet tbd" is supported by the table.

According to row 44 of the table, the Army-Navy game is TBD (to be determined) for the Air Force-Army and Air Force-Navy scores, but the location is confirmed to be Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium) on December 10, 2016. Therefore, the statement "An Army-Navy game will be played on 10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD" is supported by the table.
1100	Refuted. While the scores for many Air Force-Navy games have been recorded in the table, the statement that "the scores for Air Force-Navy have all been decided up until 2018" is incorrect. Row 43 of the table indicates that the Air Force-Navy match to be played on October 4, 2014, was still "tbd" (to be determined) at the time the table was created. Additionally, row 44 indicates that the scores for the 2016 match were also "tbd" (to be determined) at the time of creation. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that all the scores for Air Force-Navy have been decided up until 2018.
1101	Refuted. According to row 13 of the table, the Air Force vs. Navy score in the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy for the 1983 season was 44-17, and it is not listed as "tbd."
1102	Refuted. According to the table, the 2014 and 2016 seasons did not have an Army-Navy game scheduled to be played in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium). Additionally, the 2018 season simply states "TBD" for all three scores under the column "army-navy score," so it cannot be determined whether or not a game is scheduled to be played in Baltimore.

1108	Refuted. According to the table, in 2010, Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia won the girls doubles title at the Indonesian National Badminton Championships, but the boys doubles title was won by Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.

The duration listed in the "duration" column for his appearances is "3" which matches the number of episodes listed for him. Therefore, the statement that the duration of 02x03-03x05 is listed for Max Martini is false since his episodes are listed as 02x08, 03x20-03x22.
1115	Refuted. According to row 18 of the table, Bob Keaton's first appearance was in the episode "Big Brother," not "Vengeance" as stated in the statement.
1116	Refuted. According to the table, the home team St Kilda played against the away team North Melbourne, who had a score of 12.11 (83), but the statement suggests that North Melbourne was the home team, which is not true.

1122	Refuted. According to the table, on 13 July 1946, the home team Essendon scored 16.24 (120) against Footscray, not 14.8 (92). None of the teams in the table have a score of 14.8 (92) on that date. Therefore, the statement is refuted.

1125	Refuted. According to the table, the college whose nickname is Blue Hose joined the North State Conference in 1965 and left in 1972. However, it is currently a member of Big South conference, not the SAC as mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement is false.
1126	Supported. According to row 17 of the table, St. Andrews University left North State Conference in 2012 and joined the AAC (NAIA) conference. However, it is not specified which college left in 1974 and 1989.
1127	Refuted. According to the table, in 2012 the Oakland Raiders defeated the Kansas City Chiefs on December 16 with a score of 15-0, and it was played at the OCO Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1128	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, the feature "VLAN settings for Intel AMT network interfaces" is available in AMT 3.0 for desktop devices. Therefore, the statement that this feature is available on AMT 3.0 is supported by the table.
1129	Refuted. According to row 30 of the table, the feature of "vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces" is present in the Intel AMT versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 & 8.0, but it is not present in Intel AMT version 3.0. Therefore, having the feature of vlan settings for Intel AMT network interfaces means that the computer does not have version 3.0 of Intel AMT.
1130	Supported. According to the table, all of the representatives in Pennsylvania were either re-elected or first elected before the 1980s except for George Gekas who won the election in Pennsylvania17 in 1982, making him the only representative who was first elected in the 1980s. Therefore, the statement "Pennsylvania17 is the only district that had someone first elected in the 1980s" is supported by the table.
1131	Refuted. According to the table, only one incumbent was first elected in 1974, which was John Murtha, a Democrat. All the other incumbents were first elected either before or after 1974. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the number of Republican and Democratic incumbents first elected in 1974.
1132	Supported. According to the table, William F Goodling is listed as a Republican incumbent who was re-elected in Pennsylvania's 19th district, which means that he was one of the six Republican incumbents to be re-elected in the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections. Therefore, the statement "William F Goodling was one of six Republican incumbents to be re-elected" is supported by the table.
1133	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, Bud Shuster ran in the election as a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania's 9th district and was unopposed, meaning he did not face any opponents in the election. Therefore, the statement that "Bud Shuster ran unopposed in the election" is supported by the table.
1134	Refuted. According to the table, only one incumbent (William F. Goodling from Pennsylvania19) was first elected in 1974 and re-elected in 1994. Therefore, the statement "there were two Republican incumbents that were first elected in 1974" is incorrect.
1135	Refuted. According to the table, the incumbent for Pennsylvania12 is John Murtha, not Ron Klink. Hence, the statement "District Pennsylvania12 has incumbent Ron Klink" is refuted by the table.
1136	Refuted. The table does not provide any specific value for the bore of 9 adr, or any other engine, as it only mentions "mm (in)" in the bore column. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the table if 9 adr has a bore of mm (in) like every other bore in the table.
1137	Partially supported. According to row 13 of the table, Spy vs Spy is listed as an arcade game and was released for both the C64 and ZX Spectrum. The table does indicate that it was also released for the Amstrad CPC, which is listed under the "others" column. However, the table does not explicitly mention that Spy vs Spy was released specifically for the arcade genre on the Amstrad CPC.
1138	Refuted. According to the table, there is no title with the name "Kriegspiel" in the genre "arcade" in any year listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "there is only one year (1983) with a title of kriegspiel in the genre arcade" is not supported by the table.
1139	Refuted. According to the table, Spy vs Spy is listed under the arcade genre for the C64 and ZX Spectrum, and under arcade and strategy for Amstrad CPC. It is not listed with the Dragon 32 at all. Therefore, the statement that Spy vs Spy is listed under the arcade genre with Dragon 32 is incorrect.
1140	Which year do you mean by "on june 16th"? There are races on June 16th of different years in the table. Please provide more details.
1141	Supported. According to row 17 of the table, the Pocono 400 race held on June 8th, 1997 had 200 laps and was won by Jeff Gordon.
1142	Supported. According to row 16 of the table, Jeff Gordon won the Pocono 400 in June 1996 and drove for Hendrick Motorsports during that race. Therefore, the statement that "on June 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon drove for Hendrick Motorsports" is supported by the table.
1143	Supported. According to row 17 of the table, Jeff Gordon finished the Pocono 400 race in 1997 with a time of 3:34:33.
1144	Refuted. According to the table, Jeff Gordon won the Pocono 400 on June 8, 1997, June 16, 1996, and June 11, 1995, all driving for Hendrick Motorsports but in a Chevrolet, not a Ford. Therefore, the statement that Jeff Gordon was the driver in a Ford for Hendrick Motorsports on June 16th is refuted by the table.
1145	Supported. According to row 17 of the table, Jeff Gordon finished the 1997 Pocono 400 with 200 laps and an average speed of 139.828 mph. Therefore, the statement that in 1997, Jeff Gordon finished 200 laps with an average speed of 139.104 mph is incorrect.
1146	Refuted. According to row 21 of the table, the team for Ricky Rudd during the 2001 Pocono 400 was Robert Yates Racing, not Joe Gibbs Racing. Therefore, the statement that "the team for Ricky Rudd is Joe Gibbs Racing" is incorrect.
1147	Refuted. According to the table, Jeff Gordon was the driver with 200 laps in 1997. Therefore, the statement that Jeremy Mayfield was the driver with 200 laps in 1997 is incorrect.
1148	Supported. According to row 14 of the table, the episode "Easy Come, Easy Go" of Freddy's Nightmares season 13 was directed by William Malone. Therefore, the statement "season 13 was directed by William Malone" is supported by the table.
1149	Supported. According to row 18 of the table, Gilbert Adler directed the episode titled "Funhouse" of Freddy's Nightmares. Therefore, the statement "Gilbert Adler directed Funhouse" is supported by the table.
1150	Supported. According to rows 16 and 17 of the table, the episode titled "Interior Loft" was directed by Ken Wiederhorn and originally aired on January 22, 1990.
1151	Refuted. According to the table, William Malone directed episode 13 titled "Easy Come, Easy Go" which is a part of the series' second season, after season 6. Therefore, the statement "William Malone never directed after season 6" is incorrect.
1152	Partially supported. According to row 19 of the table, the episode titled "Dust to Dust" was directed by Jonathan Glassner, Bill Froehlich, David Braff, and Jonathan Glassner, who were also the writers. The episode titled "Funhouse" was directed by Gilbert Adler, but the writer was listed as A L Katz and Gilbert Adler. Therefore, the statement that "Funhouse was directed by Al Katz and written by Gilbert Adler" is partially supported (Adler did direct the episode but did not have sole writing credit).
1153	Refuted. The statement is not supported or refuted by the table as there are multiple records and times listed in the table for different racing series, including NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, and the Izod IndyCar Series. Additionally, there is no column in the table specifically labeled "record" and "time," so it's unclear which specific data points the statement is referring to.
1154	Supported. According to row 12 of the table, the time for the record qualifying was 24.521, which means the statement "the time for the record qualifying was 24.521" is supported by the table.
1155	Refuted. According to row 12 of the table, Richie Hearn set the qualifying record of 24.521 seconds on September 6, 2003. Therefore, he could not have held the record before September 2003.
1156	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, the regional GVA (Gross Value Added) for the year 2007 was 9432 and the industry contribution to GVA was listed as 1565. Therefore, the statement "in the year 2007 the regional GVA was 9432 and the industry was listed as 1565" is supported by the table.
1157	Refuted. According to the table, the sum of agriculture for all five years (1995-2007) is 54, which means that the statement "the total sum of the agriculture is 54 when including all 5 years listed" is correct so far. However, since the table only lists data for the years 1995, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2007, it is impossible to determine if the statement is true for all years beyond this range.
1158	The statement is not relevant to the table provided. The table only contains data for a single region for different years and does not provide enough information to calculate an average for services based on the given conditions (when year is greater than 2003, when industry is less than 1465, and when regional gva is greater than 9432). Additionally, there is no reference to an average services value in the table. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
1159	Not fully supported. While it's true that agriculture is 11 (not 54) and regional GVA is 6584, which satisfies the first two conditions of the statement, we cannot determine whether the third condition "when services is less than 7502" and the fourth condition "when industry is less than 1565" are simultaneously true or not. The table only gives the values for each sector individually by year, so we cannot compare their values across different years. Therefore, we cannot fully support or refute the statement.
1160	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season.
1161	The statement is unclear, but assuming that it means "114 matches were played when a team's total points were 107 and when their points in 1987-88 were 31," then the statement is refuted. As per the table, no team has a total of 107 points or 31 points during the 1987-88 season. Therefore, it is not valid to assume that they could have played 114 matches under those conditions.
1162	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Jaysuma Saidy Ndure from Norway ran the race in lane 6 with a time of 20.45 seconds, and the reaction time (react) was 0.131, which is less than 0.164. Therefore, the statement "at 20.45 the react was less than 164 in lane 6" is supported by the table.
1163	Supported. According to the table, the time for Wallace Spearmon of the United States was 20.39 seconds, which is more than the time for Rondell Sorillo of Trinidad and Tobago, whose time was 20.63 seconds.

1164	Refuted. The table shows that Visa Hongisto from Finland was in lane number 3, not lane number 9.
1165	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, the Indianapolis Colts played against the New York Giants on September 10 at Giants Stadium, and the final score was 26-21 in favor of the Colts.

1166	Refuted. According to row 15 of the table, the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New Orleans Saints took place on December 10; however, the final score shows that the Dallas Cowboys lost 42-17 to the New Orleans Saints, not the other way around.
1167	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, the game played on September 17 was between Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium, and the final score was 10-27 in favor of Dallas Cowboys. Therefore, the statement "on September 17, the final score at Texas Stadium was 10-27" is supported by the table.
1168	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, on September 10, 2006, the Indianapolis Colts were the visiting team at Giants Stadium and the final score was 26-21 in favor of the Colts. Therefore, the statement that "when the Indianapolis Colts were the visiting team at Giants Stadium, the final score was 26-21" is supported by the table.
1169	Refuted. According to the table, the Denver Broncos and the Chicago Bears did not play at the RCA Dome. Additionally, there is no game listed with a final score of 23-8 in which the Denver Broncos played against any team. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1170	Refuted. The statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the game between the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks did not take place on December 31 but on January 6 (as shown in row 20 of the table). Second, the final score was 21-20 with the Seahawks winning, not 20-9 with the Cowboys leading.
1171	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, the game on September 17 was between the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys, not at Soldier Field. Therefore, the statement that the final score on September 17 at Soldier Field was 10-27 is refuted by the table since there was no game played at Soldier Field on that date.
1172	Refuted. The final score for the game at Giants Stadium when the Indianapolis Colts were the visiting team was 26-21, as shown in row 3 of the table. There is no record of the Chicago Bears playing at Giants Stadium in this table.

1175	Refuted. According to row 9 of the table, Roger Dutton and Tony Wright received 3 points, whereas the statement says that they received the fewest points (2) which is not true.
1176	Refuted. According to the table, the BMW ridden by Barry Dungworth and R.W. Turrington achieved a speed of 82.32 mph, which is the 5th fastest speed among all machines in the race. Moreover, they scored 6 points, as shown in row 6 of the table. Therefore, the statement that "the BMW has less than 6 points with a speed of 82.32 mph" is not supported by the table.
1177	Refuted. According to the table, only two teams had wins: BVM-Minardi team in the Formula Renault 2.0 Italy Winter Series in 2007, where Cesare Ramos won four races, and BVM-Target Racing in the Italian Formula Three Championship in 2010, where Ramos won three races. Therefore, not every team had several wins.
1178	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, the 8th-ranked player, Charles Howell III, is from the United States. Therefore, the statement "the United States is the home country of the 8th-ranked player" is supported by the table.

1180	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, Vijay Singh accumulated 19,129 points over 23 events in the 2007 FedEx Cup playoffs, and his reset points were 99,000. Therefore, the statement "99000 is the number of reset points for 23 events" is supported by the table.
1181	Refuted. According to row 3 of the table, Vijay Singh is from Fiji, not the United States. Therefore, the statement "United States is the country where the player Vijay Singh is from" is refuted by the table.
1182	Refuted. The table provided does not have any information about reset points for any value of events, let alone an event with 56 events. The reset points are only mentioned for the top 5 players, and the lowest reset point mentioned is 96,500 for the player in the 9th position. Therefore, the statement "99012 is the lowest reset points where the events are 56" is refuted as it contains misinformation not present in the table.
1183	Supported. According to row 9 of the table, 25.7 million international tourists visited Russia in 2012.
1184	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, in the UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) region of Asia, there were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012, which is the same as the number of arrivals in 2011. Therefore, the statement "in the unwto region of asia, 57.7 million international tourist arrivals (2012) which was less than in 2011" is incorrect, as the number of tourist arrivals in 2012 remained unchanged from the previous year.
1185	Refuted. There is no information in the table that suggests that any state was continuously led by the sovereigns mentioned from 830 BC. Each state had a different ruler and none of them were listed as being in power for an extended period of time that includes 830 BC. Hence, the statement that "from 830 BC, the state is song" is not supported by the table.
1186	Supported. According to row 9 and 10 of the table, Jin had two sovereigns with the name "Xi" and "Xian" who held the title of "Marquis" under the Royal House of Ji. Therefore, the statement "Xi or Xian is the name when the state is Jin" is supported by the table.
1187	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the state is Cai, the name of the sovereign is Yi, and the royal house is Ji. Therefore, the statement "Yi is the name when the royal house is Ji and the state is Cai" is supported by the table.
1188	Supported. According to rows 9 and 10 of the table, Xi and Xian were both state leaders in Jin, with the title of Marquis. However, since according to the statement the "state is Jin and the title is Duke," it should be noted that Jin was known to have held the title of Duke of Jin, which is equivalent to the title of Marquis in other Chinese states. Therefore, the statement "Xi or Xian is the name when the state is Jin and the title is Duke" is supported by the table.
1189	Refuted. According to the table, Yi was the name when the royal house was Ji and the state was Cai, but he was a Marquis and he assumed his post in 837 BC, not in 826 BC. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1190	Refuted. According to row 17 of the table, the state with "from" year 830 BC is Song, not Wey. Therefore, the statement "when the from is 830 BC, the state is Wey" is incorrect.
1191	Supported. According to row 6 of the table, Greg Monroe had the highest number of rebounds (8) during the game against Charlotte on October 16th.

Hence, the statement "Greg Monroe had the high of 8 rebounds against Charlotte on October 16th making their record 2 - 4" is supported by the table.
1192	Refuted. According to row 3 of the table, Rodney Stuckey scored 16 points, making him the highest scorer for the game. However, Greg Monroe did not score the highest number of rebounds in this game. He had 7 rebounds, but Austin Daye had the most rebounds with 8. Therefore, the statement that Greg Monroe scored the highest number of rebounds and Rodney Stuckey scored the highest number of points in the game is incorrect.
1193	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, in the game against Dallas, Austin Daye scored the highest number of points for Detroit Pistons (16). Therefore, the statement "player Austin Daye (16) scored the highest number of points in the game and the team was Dallas" is supported by the table.
1194	Supported. According to row 5, Will Bynum scored the highest number of assists with 5 in the game against Minnesota. And according to the same row, the attendance was 11,747 people at the Carrier Dome.
1195	Refuted. According to the table, the game in which Austin Daye did the high rebounds was game 4 against the Dallas Mavericks, in which the Pistons lost (score 96-101). However, their record in that game was 2-2, not 2-4. Therefore, the statement "2-4 is the record in the game where Austin Daye (16) did the high rebounds" is not supported by the table.
1196	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, Ben Gordon had the high points (17) in the game against Miami, while both Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva had the high rebounds (5). Therefore, the statement that "Ben Gordon (17) did the high rebounds in the game in which Rodney Stuckey (16) did the high points" is false.
1197	Unsupported. The table only provides the highest points scored by players for each game, not the lowest points. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the table which game in which Austin Daye scored the lowest points, if any.
1198	Refuted. According to the table, Will Bynum did the high assists for the Detroit Pistons at the Carrier Dome on October 15th, but the attendance for that game was 11,747, not 11747 as stated in the statement. The attendance is a specific number, not a form of writing out the number.
1199	Refuted. According to the table, Corey Peters is not the only defensive tackle drafted by the Atlanta Falcons; he is just the one with the highest overall pick of 83. Therefore, the statement that "the only defensive tackle is Corey Peters, with a pick number of 19" is not true.
1200	None
1201	Refuted. According to row 11 of the table, the game on March 19th was won by the Seattle Supersonics with a score of 112-91 against the Houston Rockets. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table, but the score was 112-91, not 128-106.
1202	Refuted. According to row 12 of the table, the location attendance was Hemisfair Arena and the opposing team was San Antonio Spurs, not Golden State Warriors. Therefore, the statement that Golden State Warriors is the name of the team when the location attendance is Hemisfair Arena 16057 is incorrect.
1203	Refuted. According to row 7 of the table, the game played on March 10 against the Detroit Pistons was not the game where Gary Payton had the highest assists. In that game, he had 5 assists, while his highest number of assists in a game was 11 (on March 15 against the Dallas Mavericks). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1204	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, the date for the game with a score of "w 112 - 91" against the Houston Rockets is "March 19". Therefore, the statement that "the date for the score of w 112 - 91 is after March 19" is false.

1206	Refuted. The statement is incorrect and not supported by the table. According to the table, track 23 is actually "He'll Have to Go", which means that it does not have the title "Just a Little Bit".
1207	Supported. According to the table, Larry Mize and D A Weibring are tied for 5th place in the 1988 U.S. Open Golf tournament, with a score of 208 and a to par of -5. Therefore, the statement "players Larry Mize and D A are tied for 5th place" is supported by the table.

1209	Refuted. According to the table, Mark O'Meara had a score of 71 + 72 + 66 = 209. Therefore, the statement "Mark O'Meara had a score of 71 + 72 + 66 = 209" is supported by the table.
1210	Supported. According to row 9 of the table, Fred Couples' score in the 1988 U.S. Open was 72 + 67 + 71 = 210. Therefore, the statement "Fred Couples had a score of 72 + 67 + 71 = 210" is supported by the table.
1211	Supported. According to row 6 and 7 of the table, Larry Mize and D.A. Weibring are tied for 5th place with a score of 208. Therefore, the statement is partially correct as it mentions Larry Mize, but Scott Simpson is also tied for 5th place.
1212	Refuted. According to the table, Fred Couples' score is 72 + 67 + 71 = 210, not 70 + 71 + 70 = 211. Therefore, the statement that Fred Couples has a score of 70 + 71 + 70 = 211 is incorrect.
1213	Refuted. According to row 8 of the table, Mark O'Meara did score 71+72+66=209, but he is not the second player to achieve it, he is the seventh player on the list. Therefore, the statement "Mark O'Meara is the second player with 71+72+66=209 as the score" is incorrect.
1214	Refuted. According to row 9 of the table, Fred Couples had a score of 210, which is not larger than 210. Therefore, the statement "Fred Couples had a score larger than 210" is false according to the table.

1216	Supported. According to row 25 of the table, the score of the Super League XII match between Salford City Reds and Bradford Bulls on July 21, 2007, was 14-10, which matches with the statement.
1217	Refuted. According to row 12 of the table, the game on 15/04/07 was between Bradford and Hull KR, and the score was 52-22, but the attendance was 10881, not 9000. Therefore, the statement that the score on 15/04/07 was 52-22 with attendance of 9000 is incorrect.
1218	Refuted. According to row 25 of the table, the score on July 21, 2007, was 14-10, but the home team was Salford City Reds, not Bradford.

The table also shows that Richmond scored 3.8 (26) in that match while North Melbourne scored 5.12 (42), which supports that statement that "on 7 May 1960, a crowd of 9000 watched the away team, Richmond, score 3.8 (26)" at the specified venue and match.
1220	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the away team Richmond scored 3.8 (26) against the home team North Melbourne, who scored 5.12 (42). Therefore, the statement that "3.8 (26) was the away team score against a home team that scored 5.12 (42)" is supported by the table.
1221	Refuted. According to the table, the home team playing on May 7th, 1960 with a score of 5.12 (42) was North Melbourne, while the away team was Richmond. The crowd count for that match was 9000, which is lower than 23135 mentioned in the statement. Moreover, the away team score of 3.8 (26) and home team score of 5.12 (42) do not correspond with the match for which crowd attendance was mentioned. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
1222	Refuted. According to the table, only Ryan Hunter-Reay meets the conditions stated in the statement: He scored only one point and started from grid position 9, while racing for American Spirit Team Johansson. However, Jimmy Vasser scored zero points and started from grid position 16, which also meets the condition of starting grid larger than 4 but he did not race for American Spirit Team Johansson. Therefore, the statement is only partially true and is ultimately refuted because Jimmy Vasser was not on the American Spirit Team Johansson team.
1223	Refuted. The only player from the Patrick Racing team in the table is Oriol Servià, whose grid position was 4, not larger than 4. Additionally, the statement only mentions players with fewer than 2 points, but Ryan Hunter-Reay had already earned one point according to the table. Therefore, neither Ryan Hunter-Reay nor Oriol Servià fulfill both parts of the statement, so the statement is refuted.

1282	Refuted. According to the table, the driver who started in grid 5, Michele Alboreto, completed 43 laps before retiring due to an engine issue. However, it doesn't make sense to say "the least amount of laps is 43.0" as it's only true for one driver in one race. The least amount of laps completed by any driver in the race was 1 lap, by Satoru Nakajima, who retired due to a drive-shaft issue.

1317	Refuted. The notes column is empty for the 1986 New York City Marathon, which means that no notes were recorded for that year. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether Orlando Pizzolato's notes for the 1986 New York City Marathon are 2:15:20 or not.
1318	Refuted. The statement is not correct in multiple ways. Firstly, the Olympic Games were not held at Venice, Italy in 1984.

1319	Unclear. The table does not provide information on whether or not there are currently 12 T-260 EU aircraft in service. The table only provides information on the number of T-260 EU aircraft that were in service at the time the table was created.
1320	Refuted. According to the table, there are three Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante aircraft in service, but the type of aircraft listed in the "Versions" column is "C-95," which is not accurate. The correct type of the Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante is EMB 110, which is different from C-95.
1321	Unclear. The table only provides information on the number of Aermacchi SF260 trainers (12) and does not mention any information about T-260 EU aircraft. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not there are 12 T-260 EU aircraft currently in service with the Uruguayan Air Force.

1325	Refuted. According to the table, there is no Embrarer Emb 120 Brasilia from Switzerland present in the Uruguayan Air Force aircraft list. The Embraer Emb 120 Brasilia is listed, but it is originated from Brazil, not Switzerland. However, the type of aircraft is correctly listed as a transport.

According to the table, Brazil is the origin of two types of aircraft in the list - Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante and Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia - and both are listed under the transport/utility category. Additionally, the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, which is listed under the attack/fighter category, was manufactured in the United States. Therefore, it can be inferred that Brazil has transport/utility and the United States has both transport/utility and attack type aircraft.
1327	Unsupported. According to row 12 of the table, there are 12 Aermacchi SF260 aircraft currently in service that originated from Italy. There is no mention of any T-260 EU aircraft in the table.

1328	Refuted. According to row 16 of the table, the Bell 212 Twin Huey is categorized as a transport/utility aircraft, not a trainer type. Therefore, the statement that "the aircraft Bell 212 Twin Huey was a trainer type" is refuted.

1439	Refuted. According to row 11 of the table, life expectancy total in 1995-2000 is 69.3 and the infant mortality rate (IMR) is 34. Therefore, the statement that life expectancy in 1995-2000 is less than 61.5 and the IMR is exactly 27 is not supported by the table.
1440	Refuted. There are two rows in the table where the number of deaths per year is 1,058,000. These are row 10 (1990-1995) and row 11 (1995-2000). However, the corresponding crude death rates (CDR) for these two rows are 6.8 and 6.5, respectively. None of the rows in the table have a CDR of 22.6.
1441	Refuted. According to the table, the period where there were 900,000 deaths per year was from 1950-1955, during which the natural change per year was 1,672,000 (row 1, second column) and not 2,500,000 as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1442	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, the total fertility rate (TFR) was 2.45 during the period 1995-2000, which is the same period during which the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 43. Therefore, the statement "there was a TFR of 2.45 in the period where the IMR was 43" is supported by the table.
1443	Refuted. According to the table, there were 3,741,000 live births per year during the period from 1975 to 1980. Therefore, the statement "there are 3,624,000 live births per year in the period from 1975 to 1980" is not supported by the table.
1444	The statement is not possible to evaluated. The conditions expressed in the statement are contradictory. It is impossible for the cultural and educational panel to be smaller than 0 and for the nominated by the taoiseach to be less than 11. Moreover, the table shows counts for each party in each panel or university, not specific panels/nominations.
1445	Refuted. According to row 3, Josè Ortiz played center for the Utah Jazz from 1988 to 1990, but the table does not provide any information on a connection between Ortiz and the Oregon State basketball team. Therefore, the statement that Ortiz was the center for the Oregon State Jazz club is unsupported by the table.
1446	Refuted. The statement is incorrect because there was no "Houston Jazz" club team or any team named Houston and Andre Owens did not play for the Utah Jazz during the 2005-06 season according to the table. He played as a guard for the Utah Jazz during that season.
1447	The table provides information about the Utah Jazz all-time roster and does not include any information about a jazz club in Houston or any other city. So, the table does not support or refute the statement.
1448	Refuted. According to the table, Dan O'Sullivan played center for the Utah Jazz during the 1990-91 season, but his school/club team is listed as Fordham. There is no mention of a "Fordham Jazz club," so it cannot be concluded that he played for such a team.
1449	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Greg Ostertag played the center position for the Utah Jazz from 1995 to 2004 and then again from 2005 to 2006. Therefore, the statement that Ostertag played the center position for the Jazz from 1995 to 2004 and then from 2005 to 2006 is supported by the table.
1450	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Greg Ostertag played as a center for the Utah Jazz for two separate time periods (1995-2004, 2005-06) and attended the University of Kansas. Therefore, the statement "Greg Ostertag played center and went to Kansas" is supported by the table.
1451	Refuted. According to the table, Greg Ostertag played for the Jazz from 1995-2004 and then again in the 2005-2006 season. However, he did not attend Oregon State University. That information applies to Josã Ortiz instead according to row 3 of the table.
1452	Refuted. According to row 6 of the table, Andre Owens played as a guard for the Utah Jazz from 2005 to 2006, not as a center. Therefore, the statement "Andre Owens played center for the Jazz from 2005-06" is refuted by the table.
1453	Refuted. There is no Houston graduate from Turkey listed in the table. There is an Andre Owens who played for the Jazz from 2005-06, but he is listed as a guard and his school is not mentioned in the table. Similarly, there is a player from Turkey listed, Mehmet Okur, but he did not attend the University of Houston or any other Houston school.
1454	Refuted. According to row 5 of the table, Dan O'Sullivan played for Utah Jazz as a center in 1990-91, but he did not attend the University of Kansas. The table does not provide any information regarding his college education, and he might have played for a different school before joining the Utah Jazz.
1455	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Mehmet Okur's position was a forward-center for the Utah Jazz and his club team, Efes Pilsen in Turkey, meaning his position on both teams was the same. Therefore, the statement that his position was center in the club team of Efes Pilsen (Turkey) is supported by the table.
1456	Partially supported. According to the table, there are four seasons in which the team finished with a gb (games behind) of 5: 1980, 1999, 2006, and 2010. Their win percentages for those seasons are 0.678, 0.571, 0.528, and 0.535, respectively. The average of these win percentages is approximately 0.578 rather than exactly 0.535, as stated in the statement. Therefore, while the win percentage of the seasons with a gb of 5 is almost equal to 0.535, the statement that it is exactly 0.535 is refuted by the data in the table.
1457	Refuted. The table does not provide enough information to support this statement. While row 34 does indicate that the Nashville Sounds had a record of 77-67 in the 2010 season while finishing 5th in the league with a divisional GB of 4, the preceding statement regarding average win percentage based on a certain GB is not reflected by the data provided in the table.
1458	Unclear. The table does not have any row where the GB (games behind the division leader) is exactly 5, so there are no seasons in the table with this condition. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the average win percentage for this condition based on the data in the table.
1459	Refuted. The table does not provide information about the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1460	Supported. According to row 5 of the table, Sidney R. Yates was the incumbent for Illinois 9 and was first elected in 1964. Therefore, the statement "the fourth elected incumbent Sidney R. Yates was in 1964" is supported by the table.
1461	The statement is incorrect. Sidney R. Yates is listed as the incumbent for Illinois 9, not Illinois 10, in the table and is noted as being a Democrat, not a Republican. Furthermore, the table shows that he was re-elected in 1974, not first elected in 1964. Therefore, the statement "Sidney R. Yates of Illinois 10 was elected as incumbent from Republican Party in 1964" is refuted by the table.
1462	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Leanne Baker was the runner-up in the tournament held on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on a hard surface. Mirielle Dittmann was her opponent in the final and the score was 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-7(5). Therefore, the statement "Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand" is supported by the table.
1463	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, Leanne Baker won on 2 May 1999 in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico and the surface was hard. Therefore, the statement "on 2 May 1999, the surface was hard" is supported by the table.
1464	Refuted. According to row 4 of the table, the opponent in the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on hard surface was Mireille Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperova. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1465	Refuted. According to row 2 of the table, the surface was hard, not grass, during the tournament that Leanne Baker won on May 2, 1999 in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Therefore, the statement that the surface was grass on May 2, 1999, is not supported by the table.
1466	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, Volume 5 of the series has 1 disc and 4 episodes, and it was released on September 19, 2006, but in Region 1, rather than region 1. Therefore, the statement "volume 5, of 4 episodes, took place on September 19, 2006, in region 1" needs to be corrected to "volume 5, of 4 episodes, was released on September 19, 2006, in Region 1."
1467	Supported. According to the table, all volumes have only one disc released. There is no indication in the table that any volume has more than one disc. Therefore, the statement "the highest number of discs released for any of the volumes is only 1" is supported by the table.

1471	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, there were 4 episodes in Region 4, and the release date for those episodes was March 13, 2008. Therefore, the statement "there were four episodes in region 4 on March 13, 2008" is supported by the table.
1472	Refuted. According to the table, the Volume that has 1 disc, 4 episodes, and a Region 1 release date of May 30, 2006 is Volume 3, not Volume 5.
1473	Refuted. According to the table, all volumes have one disc with four episodes each. Therefore, the statement that volumes 2, 4, and 5 have 2 discs and 3 episodes is incorrect.
1474	Refuted. The table does not provide any information about a region 1 episode that aired in September or a region 2 episode that aired earlier. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is true or false based on the information provided in the table.
1475	Supported. According to row 1 of the table, each volume has 1 disc, so there is exactly one disc.
1476	Refuted. According to the table, on March 15, 2007, only one volume with four episodes was released in Region 4. Therefore, there is no information in the table to support the statement that "on March 15, 2007, and in region 2, the highest number of episodes is 3".

1480	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, in 1980, VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 18-12, was seeded 12th in the East region, and lost their only game in the tournament with a score of 72-86. Additionally, the statement is correct in noting that the year 1980 is smaller than 1996.
1481	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the VCU Rams Men's Basketball team had a record of 18 - 12 in the year 1980. Therefore, the statement "the earliest year with a record of 18 - 12 was the year 1980" is supported by the table.
1482	Refuted. According to the table, the best record listed is actually 28-12, achieved in the 2011 season when they were a seed of 11. The 2012 season mentioned in the statement had a record of 29-7, which is only one win more than the 2011 season, but they were a 12 seed instead of a 5 seed. Therefore, the statement that the best record listed is 29-7 in 2012 when they received a 5 seed is refuted by the table.
1483	Refuted. The results listed in row 11 of the table show that VCU Rams men's basketball team won five consecutive games, but the record of the team during that season was actually 28-12, which is different from the record of 27-9 mentioned in the statement.
1484	Supported. According to row 2 of the table, the VCU Rams lost in 1980 with a score of 72-86. Additionally, the seed for that game was 12.

1485	Refuted. According to the table, in 1980, VCU Rams Men's Basketball received the 12 seed in the East region and their record was 18-12. Therefore, the statement that they received the 11 seed is incorrect.

Therefore, the statement "in 1997 David Duchovny was nominated for best actor in a leading role" is ambiguous and requires further clarification.
1489	Partially supported. According to the table, the earliest year when the role/episode is Fox Mulder and the result is nominated is indeed 1996 (row 2). However, there is no mention of the role/episode being Fox Mulder in row 2.

1564	Refuted. Looking at the table, there are no wins listed for Chris DiMarco in any of the tournaments regardless of his top 25 or top 10 finishes. Therefore, the statement is not relevant based on the data provided in the table.
1565	Refuted. The statement is not clear and appears to include an error. The column for "cuts made" in the table shows the number of times Chris DiMarco made the cut (played on the weekend) in each tournament, but it does not specify the number of times he made the cut when the top-25 is less than 4. Additionally, the statement suggests that top-5 is greater than 0 for the PGA Championship when top-25 is less than 4, but the table shows that Chris DiMarco did not win the PGA Championship and only achieved a top-5 finish once in that tournament. Overall, the statement is unclear and cannot be supported or refuted based on the information provided in the table.
1566	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, Essendon was the away team and the size of the crowd was 28,158 when they played against Geelong at Kardinia Park on July 31, 1954. Therefore, the statement "the size of the crowd when Essendon was the away team was 28,158" is supported by the table.
1567	Refuted. According to the table, Geelong played against Essendon at Kardinia Park on July 31, 1954, and the crowd size was 28,158. Therefore, the statement "the size of the crowd when Essendon was the away team was 25,158" is incorrect.

1569	Supported. According to row 7 of the table, the entry with a rating/share of 3.2/8 had 11 share ratings and 12.42 million viewers, which is more than what the statement claims.

1570	Supported. According to row 11 of the table, Olimpia finished the season with 2 wins, which is the same as the number of wins shown in the statement. Therefore, the statement "Olimpia, in position 10, has 2 wins" is supported by the table.
1571	Supported. According to the table, there is no team listed in a position higher than 10th. The highest position in the table is 10th, which is held by Olimpia, and they scored only 10 goals during the season. Therefore, the statement "the total number scored of the team positioned higher than 10 is zero" is true.
1572	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, Croatia won a total of three medals in the world taekwondo championships, two of which were silver medals. Therefore, the statement that "the nation of Croatia won 3 medals altogether, 2 of which were silver" is supported by the table.
1573	Supported. According to the table, Australia did not receive any gold medals in the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships. The total number of gold medals won by Australia in the table is 0, which matches the statement that they did not receive any gold medals.

1577	Refuted. According to the table, the episode with the original airdate of 8 June 2008 is the 4th episode in the list, but it had 1.364 million viewers, which is not the least-watched episode. The least-watched episode in the table is episode 2, with an original airdate of 25 May 2008, which had 1.481 million viewers.

1584	Refuted. The table does not show a record of 49-36%. The best record Miami Heat achieved during the 2008-09 season was 43-39, as shown in row 9 of the table. Additionally, row 4 shows that Verizon Center had a location attendance of 19,600 when Miami Heat played against the Washington Wizards, and their record at that time was 41-36.

1589	Refuted. According to the table, Cole Sprouse was nominated for the "Favorite TV Actor" category in both the 2010 (row 4) and 2011 (row 10) Kids' Choice Awards. Therefore, the statement that Cole Sprouse was not nominated for the favorite TV actor category in either of those years is incorrect.
1590	Supported. According to row 8 of the table, the attendance of the game against the New Orleans Saints was 66189, which matches the statement in the question. According to the same row, the Rams had a record of 6-1 at that point in the season, also matching the statement.

1596	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, the game with a score of 3-2 was held in Chongqing, China. Therefore, the statement "the game with a score of 3-2 was held in Chongqing, China" is supported by the table.
1597	Refuted. The statement is contradictory, as it says that the result was 3-2 and the score was 2-0 at the same time. However, none of the rows in the table match this description, so the statement is refuted.
1598	Refuted. According to the table, there were two matches played between South Korea and an opposing team during the 2010 World Cup qualification period, and neither of the matches were played at Seoul, South Korea. One match was played on February 2, 2008, in Seoul, South Korea, and the score was 1-0, not 2-1. The other match was played on October 15, 2008, in Seoul, South Korea, and the score was 4-1. Therefore, the statement "the score of the 2010 World Cup qualification was 2-1, and the venue was Seoul, South Korea" is refuted by the table.
1599	Refuted. According to the table, the game with a 4-1 score took place on June 8, 2012, in Doha, Qatar, and the opponent and competition were not specified. The game in London, England, was on March 3, 2010, and the result was 2-0, not 4-1. Therefore, both parts of the statement are incorrect.
1600	Refuted. The statement is incorrect as the game with a score of 3-2 was held in Chongqing, China and not in London, England. The venue for that match was in fact Chongqing as stated in row 3 of the table.
1601	Supported. According to row 4 of the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranks third with a total cargo load of 2939157 metric tonnes.

1604	Supported. According to row 18 of the table, the airport with a rank of 16 has a code of "ord / kord", which corresponds to the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, USA. Therefore, the statement that "rank 16 has a code (iata / icao) of ord / kord" is supported by the table.
1605	Irrelevant. The given statement only mentions the specific case of Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG/ZSPD) which is already listed in the table as "row 4". The total cargo for this airport is specified in the same row as the statement, and its value is indeed 2939157 metric tonnes. Therefore, it is unnecessary to mention the condition "when the rank is greater than 4" since it does not provide any additional information relevant to the statement.

1609	Refuted. The time value of 2:14.59.0 is associated with Brian Finch of the Velocette team, not Suzuki. Furthermore, he is ranked 7th, so the statement is incorrect on both accounts.
1610	Supported. According to row 10 of the table, series number 54, titled "The Queen's Gambit Job," was written by M. Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch. Therefore, the statement that "series number 54 was written by M. Scott Veach & Rebecca Kirsch" is supported by the table.

1612	Partially supported. According to row 2 of the table, the first episode of Season 1, titled "The Long Way Down Job," was directed by Dean Devlin. However, this does not necessarily mean that the entire season was directed by him. The table only provides information about the directors of each individual episode, not the entire season. So, while the statement that Dean Devlin directed an episode in Season 1 is supported, the statement that Season 1 is directed by Dean Devlin is not fully supported.
1613	Refuted. According to the table, Marc Roskin directed episodes in different seasons, but there is no indication that he specifically directed episodes in season 1. Therefore, the statement that "Marc Roskin directed season 1" is not supported by the table.
1614	Refuted. According to the table, "The 10 Li'l Grifters Job" was directed by Arvin Brown, not Marc Roskin, and originally aired on July 3, 2011. Therefore, the statement that it was directed by Marc Roskin is incorrect.
1615	Refuted. The Gold Job was not directed by Arvin Brown, it was directed by Marc Roskin. Additionally, the 3.22 million viewership corresponds to the episode "The Queen's Gambit Job", not "The Gold Job". Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1616	Supported. According to the table, in 1996, 1997, and 2011, the reader's vote and lifetime achievement categories were both marked as "na," meaning no winner was recorded for those categories in those years. Therefore, the statement "there are three years shown when the reader's vote was na and the lifetime achievement was na" is supported by the table.
1617	Supported. According to the table, no authors won any of the awards in 1998, including the lifetime achievement award. Therefore, the statement that "in 1998, n/a won the lifetime achievement award" is supported by the table.

1619	Supported. According to row 17 of the table, the winner of the reader's vote category in 2011 is not available, which is represented by "na". Therefore, the statement "in 2011, n/a was the reader's vote" is supported by the table.
1620	Unsupported. According to the table, there is no entry for any winner of the lifetime achievement award after the year 2008. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether or not the statement is true.
1621	Refuted. The table provides information on the winners of the Ned Kelly Awards in different categories for several years and does not give information about which winners won or did not win in other categories or years. Therefore, the statement comparing the winners of different categories in different years is not supported or refuted by the table.
1622	Supported. According to the table, there were no winners of the Best Teenage/Young Adult, Best Non-Fiction, and Lifetime Achievement categories in 2011 and "na" is mentioned for these categories. However, the winner of the Reader's Vote category in 2011 is not listed in the table, so it can be assumed that "na" won the Reader's Vote category in 2011. Therefore, the statement "na only won the reader's vote in 2011" is supported by the table.
1623	Refuted. According to the table, the Reader's Vote and Lifetime Achievement categories were marked as "na" for every single year except for one each (Bleeding Hearts by Lindy Cameron in 2001 for Reader's Vote and various authors for Lifetime Achievement in 1996). Therefore, the statement that the Reader's Vote was not "n/a" and the Lifetime Achievement was also "na" over three times is not supported by the table.

1628	Refuted. The statement does not provide clear information about what is being compared and what qualifies as "partial" for Windows and web interface. Furthermore, the information provided in the table does not support the statement since Coherence has a "partial" rating for OS X and Unix-like, not for Windows and web interface.
1629	Supported. According to row 28 of the table, Rygel has an lgplv2 (Lesser GNU Public License version 2) license, which is a type of GPL (GNU Public License). Therefore, the statement that "GPL is the license for Rygel" is supported by the table.
1630	Refuted. According to the table, the license for JRiver Media Center is not GPL. It is a proprietary license, as indicated in row 14 of the table. Therefore, the statement "GPL is the license for JRiver Media Center" is refuted by the table.
1631	Refuted. According to row 16 of the table, the home team (Manchester United) won the match 1 - 0 while playing against Bolton Wanderers. Therefore, the score was not 1-0 when the away team was Bolton Wanderers.
1632	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, in the replay match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool, the score was indeed 2-3 in favor of Liverpool. This match took place on 30/01/1991.

1636	Refuted. There is no row in the table where the home team was Wimbledon and the score was 1-0. The home team for row 6 was Luton Town and the away team was West Ham United, and the score was 1-1. The statement is not supported by the table.
1637	Supported. According to row 3 of the table, the replay between Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool had a score of 2-3, and the home team was Brighton & Hove Albion. The date mentioned in the statement (30/01/1991) matches the date of the replay mentioned in row 3, which confirms that the statement is supported by the table.
1638	Refuted. The statement is not supported by the table. None of the rows show Bolton Wanderers playing a match in the 1990-91 FA Cup against a team that won 1-0. Therefore, the scoreline mentioned in the statement and the involvement of Bolton Wanderers in the home team slot are both incorrect.
1639	Supported. According to the table, the tie number before the away team Woking (row 8) was 4 (West Ham vs. Luton Town). Therefore, the statement "5 was the tie no before the away team was Woking" is supported by the table.

The set 2 score of 16-25 for row 5 occurred on 13 Jul, while the set 2 score of 16-25 for row 6 occurred on 15 Jul.
