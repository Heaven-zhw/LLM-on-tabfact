60	Refuted. According to the table, Linda Fratianne (United States) was ranked first, Anett Pötzsch (East Germany) was ranked second, and Emi Watanabe (Japan) was ranked third. Dagmar Lurz (West Germany) was ranked fourth. Therefore, the statement "Emi Watanabe was ranked one place higher than Dagmar Lurz in the 1979 world figure skating championships" is refuted by the table.
61	Supported. According to the table, the highest score was 186.92 points (achieved by Linda Fratianne from the United States) and the lowest score was 112.28 points (achieved by Gloria Mas from Spain). Therefore, the difference between the highest and lowest score is 186.92 - 112.28 = 74.64 points. Hence the statement "there was a 74.64 point difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (112.28)" is supported by the table.
62	Supported. According to the table, Linda Fratianne from the United States won the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships and Anett Pötzsch from East Germany was ranked in second place. Therefore, the statement "Linda Fratianne was the winner and Anett Pötzsch was ranked in second place in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships" is supported by the table.
63	Supported. According to the table, Bodil Olsson was from Sweden and received 23 sp + fs, not 27 sp + fs. Therefore, the statement "Bodil Olsson was not from Switzerland and did not receive 27 sp + fs" is supported by the table.
64	This statement is not clear or accurate. The table only provides information on the rankings and scores of the top 31 competitors at the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. It does not indicate who won or lost the championship or compare the ranking with the actual winner. Therefore, the statement "Natalia Strelkova is not the female losing the skating championship" cannot be supported or refuted by the table as it is not relevant to the information provided.
65	Supported. According to the table, Emi Watanabe from Japan was ranked third with a total of 180.52 points, and Dagmar Lurz from West Germany was ranked fourth with a total of 179.96 points. Therefore, the statement "Emi Watanabe was ranked third in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships, two places higher than Dagmar Lurz" is supported by the table.
66	Refuted. The statement is incorrect because there was a 74.64 point difference between the highest score of 186.92 (achieved by Linda Fratianne of the United States) and the lowest score of 112.28 (achieved by Gloria Mas of Spain).
67	Refuted. According to the table, Linda Fratianne finished in first place with a total of 186.92 points and Anett Pötzsch finished in second place with a total of 184.36 points. Therefore, Anett Pötzsch did manage to get in the top 3. Hence, the statement "Linda Fratianne finished in first place, but Anett Pötzsch did not manage to get in the top 3" is refuted by the table.
68	Refuted. According to the table, Gloria Mas from Spain came in last place with 112.28 points. Natalia Strelkova from Soviet Union was ranked 13th with 164.94 points. Therefore, the statement "Natalia Strelkova came in last place with 112.28 points" is refuted by the table.

70	Supported. According to the table, Norbert Schramm and Stephan Bril from West Germany ranked 4th and 6th respectively. However, no one from West Germany won any medal during the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Therefore, the statement "West Germany had two of the top six but did not have anyone win a medal" is supported by the table.
71	Refuted. According to the table, Pierre Lamine has 150.5 points and Shinji Someya has 150.34 points. The difference in their points is 0.16, but it is incorrect to call it a “mere” difference, as figure skating is a sport where even small differences in points can result in significant differences in ranking. Therefore, the statement "Pierre Lamine has a mere 0.16 more points than Shinji Someya" is refuted by the table.
72	Supported. According to the table, Patrice Macrez of France finished in 7th place with a total of 151.76 points, and Pierre Lamine of France finished in 8th place with a total of 150.5 points. Therefore, France's competitors finished in consecutive positions of 7th and 8th respectively, supporting the statement.
73	Refuted. According to the table, the gap between first and last place was not a total of 58.04. The total difference in points between the first-place winner, Mark Cockerell of the United States, and the last-place skater, Marc Franquet of Belgium, was 58 points and 0.04, but not 58.04 as a total gap. Therefore, the statement "the gap between first and last was a total of 58.04" is refuted by the table.
74	Refuted. According to the table, Mark Cockerell from the United States finished first with a score of 172.42, and Patrice Macrez from France finished seventh with a score of 151.76. Therefore, the statement "Mark Cockerell finished with a worse score than Patrice Macrez" is refuted by the table.
75	Refuted. While it is true that West Germany had two of the top six skaters, Norbert Schramm and Stephan Brill, according to the table, Mark Cockerell from the United States won the gold medal (rank 1), not a skater from West Germany. Therefore, the statement "West Germany had two of the top six and won a gold medal" is refuted by the table.
76	Refuted. According to the table, Pierre Lamine of France got a total of 150.5 points and finished in 8th place while Shinji Someya of Japan got a total of 150.34 points and finished in 9th place. Therefore, Shinji Someya actually had a higher score than Pierre Lamine by a small margin and it is refuted that "Pierre Lamine beat Shinji Someya by more than a point".
77	Refuted. According to the table, Patrice Macrez of France finished in 7th place and Pierre Lamine of France finished in 8th place. Hence, both of the French competitors did not finish better than 5th. Therefore, the statement "France's competitors all finished better than 5th" is refuted by the table.
78	Refuted. According to the table, the points of the first-ranked skater were 172.42 and the points of the last-ranked skater were 114.38, which gives a difference of 58.04 points. Therefore, the statement "the gap between first and last was less than 50 points" is refuted by the table.
79	Refuted. The table shows the highest visitor score for Detroit was 4 points, which occurred twice. The first one is in the game against Carolina on January 31 (row 15) and the second one is against the New Jersey on January 29 (row 14). Therefore, the statement "Detroit had the highest visitor score, with 5 points" is refuted by the table.
80	Supported. According to the table, the Detroit Red Wings had the highest home team score of 6 points during the match against the Nashville Predators on January 5th, 2004. Therefore, the statement "Detroit had the highest home team score, at 6 points" is supported by the table.

82	Supported. According to the table, the attendance of 20066 occurred on 6 different dates (January 3, January 5, January 7, January 14, January 16, and January 29), which are the highest attendances compared to other dates. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendances were 20066, occurring on 6 dates" is supported by the table.
83	Not applicable. The table does not provide information regarding the points gap between teams during the 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season. It only provides information about the score, attendance, and win-loss record of each game played during that season.
84	The statement is ambiguous and cannot be supported or refuted by the table. The table provides the scores of the matches played by Detroit Red Wings, both as a visitor and a home team, but it doesn't provide any data on the scores of other teams who played against Detroit as a visitor. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Detroit had one of the lowest visitor scores or not based on the given table.
85	Refuted. There is no information in the table about Detroit having the highest home team score, so the statement "Detroit tied for the highest home team score" cannot be supported by the provided table.
86	Refuted. The given table does not provide any information about the scoring of other NHL teams, therefore it cannot be inferred from the table whether the Detroit Red Wings were the lowest-scoring team in the league by late January.
87	Supported. According to the table, the attendance rate of 20066 occurred four times during the 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season - on January 3rd (against Anaheim), January 5th (against Nashville), January 14th (against Chicago), and January 29th (against New Jersey). Therefore, the statement "the low attendance rate of 20066 occurred multiple times" is supported by the table.
88	Refuted. The table does not provide any information about the point gap between the Detroit Red Wings and their opponents. It only includes information about the date, visitor team, score, home team, decision, attendance, and Detroit's record throughout the season. Therefore, the statement "there was a tie for the largest point gap two times during the season" cannot be supported or refuted by this table.
89	Supported. According to the table, Bashkim Fino's term started on March 11, 1997, which was after Vilson Ahmeti's term started on December 10, 1991. Therefore, the statement "the term start for Bashkim Fino was after the term start for Vilson Ahmeti" is supported by the table.
90	Supported. According to the table, Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) all served as prime ministers of Albania and their political party affiliation during their tenure was the Socialist Party of Albania. Therefore, the statement "Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were all members of the Socialist Party of Albania political party" is supported by the table.
91	Refuted. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term end was on December 10, 1991, and Vilson Ahmeti's term end was on April 13, 1992. Therefore, the term end for Ylli Bufi was after the term end for Vilson Ahmeti. The given statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the statement "the results were counted in bhind district five times and three times in datia" is not supported by the table.
447	Refuted. According to the table, out of all the constituencies listed, Mehgaon had 210,649 electorates, which is not the highest.

448	Refuted. According to the table, Gohad had 166,893 electorates and Bhander had 139,600 electorates in the year 2009.

Therefore, the statement "seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 were in the standard format" is partially supported by the table as only two out of three seasons had at least one event in the standard format.
459	There is ambiguity in the statement regarding which season is being referred to as "season 5".

466	Supported. According to the table, three episodes (episodes 1 to 3) were aired in January, whereas only two episodes (episodes 5 and 6) were aired in February. Therefore, the statement "there were three episodes that aired in January, while only two aired in February" is supported by the table.

489	Refuted. The sum of all the home team scores is (91+110+90+128+128+73) 620. The average of all the home team scores is 620 divided by 6 (total number of games played), which equals 103.33, not 15.67. Therefore, the statement "the average of all the home team scores is 15.67" is refuted by the table.
490	Refuted. Looking at the table, only one away team (Richmond) had a score greater than 10, and there were a total of six away teams in the table. Therefore, the statement "1/3 of the away teams had a score greater than 10" is refuted by the table.

Therefore, the difference between the number of members of Fianna Fáil and Clann na Talmhan is 18, which is the same as the statement "the party with 21 total members has 18 more members than the party with the fewest total members." Hence, the statement is supported by the table.

499	Refuted. According to the table, the Fianna Fail party has the most members in the nominated by the Taoiseach section, with a total of 7 members. However, the nominated by the Taoiseach section doesn't consist solely of members from one party. In fact, members from different parties are nominated by the Taoiseach to fill the vacancies in the Seanad that cannot be filled by the electorate. Therefore, the statement "nominated by the Taoiseach has the most members from one party" is refuted by the table.
500	Refuted. According to the table, the Cultural and Educational Panel has 5 members, and the Industrial and Commercial Panel has 9 members, which means that the Industrial and Commercial Panel has 4 more members than the Cultural and Educational Panel. Therefore, the statement "Industrial and Commercial Panel has four more members than Cultural and Educational Panel" is actually reversed and should be "Industrial and Commercial Panel has four more members than Cultural and Educational Panel".
501	Supported. According to the table, the agricultural panel has 2 members and the labour panel has 5 members, which matches with the statement.
502	Supported.

503	Refuted. According to the table, the National University of Ireland (NUI) group of origin has only one member, who was nominated by Fianna Fáil. Therefore, it cannot be said that the NUI group is made up mostly of members from two parties. The parties with the most representation in the NUI panel are actually nominated by the Taoiseach and Fine Gael, each with three members. Hence, the statement "National University of Ireland is the only group of origin made up mostly of members from two parties" is refuted by the table.
504	Refuted. The table shows that Fianna Fáil has the most members across multiple panels (4 on the administrative panel, 4 on the agricultural panel, 2 on the cultural and educational panel, and 3 on the industrial and commercial panel) totaling 13 members out of 60.

Therefore, the statement "ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs" is supported by the table.
507	Refuted. The African Cup of Champions Clubs was played on a knockout basis, not on a points system, so teams did not earn points for their performance. Looking at the table, the young africans won their two matches against Lavori Publici but the scoreline mentioned is not about points, rather it represents the result of each leg of the knockout match. Therefore, the statement "the young africans scored two points in the 1971 african cup of champions clubs" is not supported by the table.
508	Supported. According to the table, Secteur 6 lost with a score of 1-2 against Enugu Rangers. Therefore, the statement "Secteur 6 lost by one against the Enugu Rangers" is supported by the table.
509	Supported.

510	Refuted. The table does not provide information about points; it only shows the scores of each match and the aggregate (total) score of each team over two legs. Therefore, the statement "canon yaounde scored five more points than their opponent" cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
511	Refuted. According to the table, ASC Diaraf did not win against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. In fact, Stade Malien won the tie by an aggregate score of 4-3 (3-0 in the first leg and 0-4 in the second leg). Therefore, the statement "ASC Diaraf won against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs" is refuted by the table.
512	Refuted. The table only shows the scores for the matches played by the Young Africans team in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs, but it does not show their total points. The statement "the Young Africans scored zero points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs" cannot be supported or refuted with the current information provided in the table.
513	Refuted. According to the table, Enugu Rangers won against Secteur 6, with a 1-1 draw in the first leg and a 1-0 win in the second leg, resulting in an aggregate score of 1-2 in favor of Enugu Rangers. Therefore, the statement "Secteur 6 won against the Enugu Rangers" is refuted by the table.

Therefore, the statement "2 games had a score of more than 10 points" is supported by the table.
519	Refuted. The table does not show any losses for the Arizona Diamondbacks player Rosales. Therefore, the statement "Arizona Diamondbacks player Rosales had a 3x loss during September" is refuted by the table.
520	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one instance where the attendance was over 50000, which was during the game against the Dodgers on September 5th with an attendance of 52270. Therefore, the statement "there were two times the attendance was over 50000" is refuted by the table.
521	Refuted. The average number of people per game during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season cannot be determined from this table. However, we can calculate the average attendance for the 27 games listed in the table by summing up the attendance values and dividing by the number of games. Doing so gives us an average attendance of approximately 34,033. Therefore, the statement "the average number of people in the game is 31,521 during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season" is refuted by the table.
522	Refuted. Both the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals played the same number of games (9) during the month of September. Therefore, the statement "the Giants have played more games than the Cardinals for the month of September" is refuted by the table.
523	Supported.

524	Refuted. The table provides information about the Arizona Diamondbacks' scores, opponents, pitchers, and attendance for various games.

525	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against the Dodgers on September 5 was 52270, which is the highest attendance among all the games mentioned in the table. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendance of the season was on September 5" is supported by the table.
526	Refuted. According to the table, the highest combined agg (aggregate score) of any game featured is between CD Elá Nguema and Primeiro de Agosto, which is 2-6. The Saint-Louis FC game has an aggregate score of 2-7, which is not the highest. Therefore, the statement "Saint-Louis FC game had the highest combined agg of any of the featured games" is refuted by the table.
527	Refuted. The 4th game on the list was CD Elá Nguema versus Primeiro de Agosto, with an aggregate score of 2-6. The sixth game on the list was ASC Police versus AS Real Bamako, with an aggregate score of 2-2 (4-5 after penalty shootout).

The Botswana Defence Force XI drew 1-1 in their 1st leg match, while Asc Police drew 1-1 in both legs and lost in a penalty shootout with a score of 4-5. Therefore, the statement "the Botswana Defence Force XI and the Asc Police games have the same 1st leg score" is refuted by the table.
531	Refuted. According to the table, the game between Saint-Louis FC and Young Africans has the highest combined aggregate (score) of 9 goals (2-7) compared to the game between Saint-Louis FC and Eleven Arrows FC which has a combined aggregate of 4 goals (2-1 for each team).

629	Partially supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 861 chassis was used in the 1986 season (row 3), but also in the 1987 season (row 4) in combination with the Zakspeed 871 chassis. Therefore, the statement "The Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in the years 1986 and 1987" is partially supported by the table.
630	Supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used on all chassis from 1985 until 1988, which was the engine used in the "zakspeed 841", "zakspeed 861", and "zakspeed 881" chassis. This means that the statement "the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used on all chassis from 1985 until 1988" is supported by the table.
631	Supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 891 chassis used a Yamaha V8 as its engine. Therefore, the statement "the zakspeed 891 chassis has multiple yamaha v8 engines" is supported by the table.
632	Supported. According to the table, the only entry for the year 1985 in the "chassis" column is "zakspeed 841". Therefore, the statement "the zakspeed 841 chassis was the only chassis from the year 1985" is supported by the table.
633	Refuted. According to the table, there were two zakspeed chassis made in 1987, namely zakspeed 861 and zakspeed 871, which are listed under row 4. Therefore, the statement "there were more than two zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987" is refuted by the table.
634	Partially Supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in 1986. However, in 1987, there were two Zakspeed chassis models, 861 and 871, which used the same engine and tyres. Therefore, the statement is partially supported as the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in the year 1986 and 1987 (along with the 871 chassis).
635	Supported. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense hold the first two positions with 13 points each. Therefore, the statement "two of the teams hold the first two positions with an equal number of points" is supported by the table.
636	Supported. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense have 13 points each, but Flamengo has a better goal difference of 8 compared to Fluminense's goal difference of 10. Therefore, the statement "the top two teams have the same number of points but separated by a goal difference" is supported by the table.
637	Supported. According to the table, four teams (Portuguesa, Vasco da Gama, América, and São Paulo) have a minus goal difference, meaning that they have conceded more goals than they have scored. On the other hand, only four teams (Flamengo, Fluminense, Corinthians, and Palestra Itália) have a positive goal difference, meaning they have scored more goals than those against them. Therefore, the statement "four of the teams have a minus goal difference while only four have scored more goals than those against them" is supported by the table.
638	Unsupported. The table doesn't provide information regarding the exact number of goals scored against each team, only the difference in goals (which is the difference between goals scored and goals against). Therefore, it cannot be determined if two of the teams have the same number of goals scored against them or not.
639	Partially supported. The statement is generally true, as three teams (Flamengo, Fluminense, and Corinthians) all have 13, 13 and 9 points respectively, but the difference is not accounted for correctly. While Flamengo and Fluminense are tied on points, the difference between them is 8 and 10 respectively, not their respective impacts versus the opposition. Furthermore, Corinthians only have a difference of 4, which is not enough to bring them level with Fluminense on that front. Therefore, while the statement is true insofar as it relates to the three teams being tied on points, the disparity between it and the differences in goal reflect a fundamental error that needs to be corrected.
640	Refuted. According to the table, the teams in the first 2 positions, Flamengo and Fluminense, both have the same amount of points which is 13. Therefore, the statement "the teams in the first 2 positions held a different amount of points with the 2nd falling behind by 2" is refuted by the table.
641	Refuted. According to the table, both the first and second team (Flamengo and Fluminense) have the same number of points, which is 13. Therefore, the statement "the second team had less points than the first and are separated by a two goal difference" is refuted by the table.
642	Refuted. According to the table, there are four teams that had a minus goal difference and four teams that had scored more goals against them. Therefore, the statement "less than 3 teams hold a minus goal difference, while more than 5 have scored more goals against them" is refuted by the table.
643	Refuted. The table provides information about points, games played, goals scored and goal difference, but it does not give information about the number of goals scored against each team. Therefore, it is not possible to support or refute the statement "over three teams have the same number of goals scored against them" using this table.
644	Refuted. According to the table, the top two teams Flamengo and Fluminense both scored 13 points, finishing at the first and second positions. Since there is no tie in the number of points, the statement "none teams tied on points" is supported. However, there is only a difference of 2 goals in the final difference between Fluminense and Flamengo. So, the statement "most were separated by more than 1 goal difference" is refuted.
645	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood had a higher home team score (12.16) in their match against South Melbourne compared to Geelong's home team score (13.12) in their match against Hawthorn. Therefore, the statement "collingwood did not have a home team score higher than that of geelong" is refuted by the table.
646	Supported. According to the table, Melbourne scored the highest away team score of 15.4 (94) during their match against Richmond on August 14, 1954. Therefore, the statement "Melbourne is the team with the highest away team score" is supported by the table.
647	Supported. According to the table, during the game between North Melbourne and Footscray which took place at Arden Street Oval, the home team (North Melbourne) and away team (Footscray) both scored 9.14 (68) which means that the home team score equals the away team score. Therefore the statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at Arden Street Oval" is supported by the table.
648	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood had a home team score of 12.16 (88) and Carlton had a home team score of 10.16 (76). Therefore, the difference between the home team scores of Collingwood and Carlton is 12.16-10.16=2.00. So, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score 2.00 points higher than that of Carlton" is incorrect.
649	Supported. According to the table, Kardinia Park was one of the venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score. Geelong was the home team, and they won the match against Hawthorn with a score of 13.12 (90) vs. 7.6 (48). Therefore, the statement "Kardinia Park was one of two venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score" is supported by the table.
650	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) while Geelong's home team score was 13.12 (90). Therefore, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score that was three times higher than that of Geelong" is refuted by the table.
651	Refuted. According to the table, the away team with the highest score is Melbourne with 94 points, playing against Richmond. The away team score for Fitzroy is 69 points, which is not the highest. Therefore, the statement "Fitzroy is the team with the highest away team score" is refuted by the table.
652	Supported. According to the table, the home team, St Kilda, scored 13.14 (92) and the away team, Fitzroy, scored 9.15 (69) at the game that took place at Junction Oval, and both teams had the same number of goals (13) at the end of the game. Therefore, the statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at junction oval" is supported by the table.
653	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) and Carlton's home team score was 10.16 (76). The difference in points between the two scores is 12. Therefore, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score 3.00 points higher than that of Carlton" is refuted by the table.
654	Refuted. According to the table, only one venue is listed, which is Kardinia Park where Geelong was the home team and won with a score of 13.12 (90) to Hawthorn's 7.6 (48). Therefore, the statement that "kardinia park was one of three venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score" cannot be inferred from the given table as there is no comparison with the scores of other venues.
655	Supported. According to the table, both 厘 and 分 have an imperial value of ~0.2133 dr, which is approximately 0.2133 pennyweights. Therefore, the statement "the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 is ~0.2133 dr" is supported by the table.
656	Supported. According to the table, the relative values for both 厘 and 分 are 1/1600. Therefore, the statement "the relative value for both 厘 and 分 is 1 / 1600" is supported by the table.
657	Supported. According to the table, the relative values for 斤 and 担 / 擔 are both equal to 1 (row 6 and 7), which means that both have a value that is at least 1. Therefore, the statement "斤 and 担 / 擔 both have a relative value that 's at least 1" is supported by the table.
658	Supported. According to the table, 担 / 擔 is the only character that has a metric value measured in kg, with a value of 60.478982 kg. Therefore, the statement "担 / 擔 is the only character that has a metric value measured in kg" is supported by the table.
659	Supported. According to the table, 錢 (cin4), 兩 (loeng2), and 斤 (gan1) all have metric values measured in grams (g), which are 3.779936375 g, 37.79936375 g, and 604.78982 g respectively. Therefore, the statement "錢, 兩, and 斤 all have metric values that are measured in g" is supported by the table.
660	Unsupported. According to the table, both 厘 and 分 have the same imperial value of ~0.2133 dr (meaning dram, a unit of mass used in the British imperial system). Therefore, the statement "the imperial values for 厘 and 分 are not equal" is unsupported.
661	Refuted. According to the table, the relative values for 厘 and 分 are the same, which is 1/1600. Therefore, the statement "the relative values for 厘 and 分 are different from each other" is refuted by the table.
662	Refuted. According to the table, 斤 has a relative value of 1, whereas 担 / 擔 has a relative value of 100. Therefore, 斤 and 担 / 擔 do not have the same relative value, and the statement "斤 and 担 / 擔 both have the same relative value" is refuted by the table.
663	Supported. According to the table, "担 / 擔" is listed in the sixth row with a metric value of 60.478982 kg, which supports the statement "担 / 擔 is one of three characters that has a metric value measured in kg". Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
664	Partially supported. According to the table, 錢 and 斤 are the only characters that have metric values, and their metric values are measured in grams (g). However, the statement does not mention anything about the other characters in the table, namely 厘, 分, and 兩. These characters also have metric values, and their metric values are measured in milligrams (mg) and grams (g), as shown in rows 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, if the statement is modified to include all characters in the table, it would be supported with the modification that 厘, 分, 兩, 錢, and 斤 are the characters that have metric values, with 錢 and 斤 having a metric value measured in grams, and the other characters having a metric value measured in milligrams or grams.
665	Supported. According to the table, Manchester United's league position remained 2nd from 17 November 2005 until the end of the season on 7 May 2006, which means that the statement "Manchester United has been 2nd in league position since 17 November 2005" is supported by the table.
666	Supported. According to the table, Manchester United played against Portsmouth twice since 13 August 2005, once on 3 December 2005 and once on 11 February 2006, and they won both games with scores of 3-0 and 3-1 respectively. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has beaten Portsmouth 2 out of 2 times since 13 August 2005" is supported by the table.
667	Refuted. According to the table, Manchester United only played against Blackburn Rovers once on September 24, 2005, where they lost 1-2 at home. They did not play against them a second time during the 2005-06 season. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has lost to the Blackburn Rovers 2 out of two times since 13 August 2005" is refuted by the table.
668	Supported. According to the table, there were a total of 19 games with an attendance of 60,000 or more, since the start of the season on 13 August 2005, making the statement "there have been 19 games since 13 august 2005 which had an attendance of 60000 or more" supported.
669	Partially supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game on 11 February 2006 was 20,206, which is indeed lower than most of the other games played that season. However, there is one game with an even lower attendance: the game against Fulham on 1 October 2005, which had an attendance of 21,862. Therefore, the statement "the game with the lowest attendance happened on 11 February 2006" is partially supported.
670	Refuted. According to the table, Manchester United played against Portsmouth twice since September 10th, 2005 - once on December 3rd, 2005, which they won by 3-0, and once on February 11th, 2006, which they won by 3-1. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has always lost 3 out of three times to Portsmouth since 10 September 2005" is completely refuted by the table.
671	Refuted. Based on the table, Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers only once on September 24, 2005, and lost the match with a score of 1-2.

672	Refuted. According to the table, only one game had the same attendance as the one on 9 April 2006, which was on 14 April 2006 against Sunderland with an attendance of 72519. Therefore, the statement "there have been 19 games since 13 august 2005 which had an attendance exactly equal to that of arsenal in 9 april 2006" is refuted by the table.
673	Refuted. According to the table, the last game of the 2005-06 season for Manchester United was on May 7th, 2006 against Charlton Athletic, which they won 4-0. Therefore, the statement "the last game of the season happened on 11 February 2006" is refuted by the table.
674	Supported. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played against the Mariners on September 8th, 9th, 10th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 27th, 29th, and 30th, which means they played against the Mariners nine times during the 2006 season. Therefore, the statement "In the 2006 season, the Texas Rangers played the Mariners nine times" is supported by the table provided.
675	Refuted. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played games not only in September but also in October. The last game of the season was played on October 1st, thus the statement that "all games in the 2006 season were played in the month of September" is not supported by the table.
676	Refuted. According to the table, there is no game in the 2006 season in which the final score was 7 - 2 for either team. Therefore, the statement "the final game score was 7 - 2 in two different games of the 2006 season" is refuted by the table.
677	Supported. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played against the Tigers on September 12 (lost 3-2 with Padilla at loss) and September 13 (lost 11-3 with Verlander as the winning pitcher), which confirms the statement "the Texas Rangers played the Tigers two times in the 2006 season".
678	Supported. According to the table, there were three games with the final score of 8-1. These games were played on September 4 against the Athletics, September 17 against the Mariners, and September 25 against the Angels.

679	Refuted. According to the table, in the 2006 season, the Texas Rangers played the Angels four times (on September 14, September 15, September 16, and September 25). Therefore, the statement "in the 2006 season the Texas Rangers played the Angels nine times" is refuted by the table.
680	Refuted. According to the table, the season listed is the 2006 Texas Rangers season, not the 2007 season. Additionally, the table shows games played in September, not October, so the statement is refuted.
681	Refuted. The table is about the 2006 Texas Rangers season and the highest game score mentioned in the table is 12-6 during a game against the Angels on September 16th, 2006. Moreover, the statement mentions the 2007 season which is not part of the table. Therefore, the statement "the final game score was 8 - 3 in two different games of the 2007 season" is refuted by the table.
682	Refuted. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played the Tigers only twice in the 2006 season; on September 12th and 13th. Therefore, the statement "the Texas Mariners played the Tigers two times in the 2008 season" is not supported by the table as the statement mentions the wrong year and teams.
683	Refuted. According to the table, there is no baseball game with a final score of 9-2. All scores are different from each other. Therefore, the statement "in four different baseball games the final score was 9 - 2" is refuted by the table.
684	Supported. According to the table, the episode titled "Gary and Allison Brooks" had the highest number of viewers for season one with 8.14 million. Therefore, the statement "in season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the most viewed episode of the season was titled Gary and Allison Brooks" is supported by the table.
685	Supported. According to the table, the episode that aired on May 20, 2009, titled "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal" had the lowest number of viewers with a 1.7/5 rating in the 18-49 demographic and 5.55 million viewers compared to other episodes in Season 1 of Gary Unmarried. Therefore, the statement "in season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the least viewed episode of the season was the finale, which aired on May 20, 2009" is supported by the table.
686	Supported. According to the table, all the episodes of the first season of "Gary Unmarried" aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm. Therefore, the statement "all new episodes of Gary Unmarried season 1 aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm" is supported by the table.
687	Refuted. According to the table, only two episode titles feature both "Gary" and "Allison" in season 1: "Gary and Allison Brooks" and "Gary Hooks Up Allison". Therefore, the statement "Four episode titles of Gary Unmarried feature the names of both Gary and Allison in season 1" is refuted by the table.
688	The statement is refuted. According to the table, there were no new episodes of Gary Unmarried in December 2009. The last episode of the season aired on May 20, 2009, and there were no further episodes available. Therefore, the statement "there were only 2 new episodes of Gary Unmarried in December of 2009" is incorrect.
689	Refuted. According to the table, the episode with the least amount of viewers was "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal" with a viewership of 5.55 million, which is less than the viewerships of some other episodes. Therefore, the statement "Gary and Allison Brooks was the episode with the least amount of viewers" is refuted by the table.

692	Refuted. According to the table, not all episodes in season one mention both Gary and Allison. For example, "Gary Moves Back In" (Row 14) and "Gary and the Trophy" (Row 19) only mention Gary in their titles. Therefore, the statement "the title of every episode in season one mentions both Gary and Allison" is refuted by the table.
693	Cannot be determined. The table provided only goes up to May 20, 2009, with the most recent episode airing on that date. Therefore, there is no information available for any episodes that may have aired in December 2009.
694	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics had a record of 37-9 after the January 30th game, which means they had already lost nine games in the season. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics only lost three games in the 1984-85 season" is not supported by the table.
695	Refuted. The table shows that the Boston Celtics played against the New York Knicks three times during the 1984-85 season and won all three games. Therefore, the statement "the New York Knicks did not win a game against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-85 season" is refuted by the table.
696	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics played eleven games at the Boston Garden in the 1984-85 season (games 34, 36, 37, 39-43, 45, and 46). Therefore, the statement "in the 1984-85 season the Boston Celtics played eight games at the Boston Garden" is refuted by the table.
697	Supported. According to the table, the highest score achieved by the Boston Celtics during the 1984-85 season was 131, which was against the Detroit Piston in the 46th game played on January 29, 1985. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics achieved their highest score against the Detroit Pistons in the 1984-85 season" is supported by the table.
698	Supported. According to the table, the Boston Celtics only played against the Chicago Bulls at the Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season, which is evident from the location column of row 6. Therefore, the statement "the Chicago Bulls only played the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season" is supported by the table.
699	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics won 63 games and lost only 19 games during the 1984-1985 season. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics lost more games than they won in the 1984-1985 season" is refuted by the table.
700	Refuted. According to the table, the Boston Celtics won both games against the New York Knicks played in the 1984-1985 season - one on January 4th, 1985, and the other on January 7th, 1985. Therefore, the statement "the New York Knicks won all home games played against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-1985 season" is refuted by the table.
701	Refuted. According to the table, out of the 14 games played so far during the 1984-1985 season, 8 of them were played in the Boston Garden (game numbers 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, and 46). Since 8 out of 14 is more than half, the statement "less than half the 1984-1985 season games were played in the Boston Garden" is refuted by the table.
702	Refuted. According to the table, the lowest scoring game for the Boston Celtics during the 1984-85 season was against the Indiana Pacers on January 18, 1985, with a score of 86-91. Therefore, the statement "the Boston Celtics achieved their lowest scoring game against the Philadelphia 76ers" is refuted by the table.
703	Refuted. According to the table, the Chicago Bulls played the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden and won on January 9, 1985 (game 36), as shown by the score of 111-108. Therefore, the statement "the Chicago Bulls were the only team to play the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden and win" is refuted by the table.
704	Refuted. Looking at the table, the statement is incorrect. There are actually eight players listed as being from the United States: Rick Adelman, Louis Amundson, J.J. Anderson, Shandon Anderson, Isaac Austin, Anthony Avent, Randy Foye, and Karl Malone.
705	Refuted. According to the table, Georgia and Penn State are only listed once each as the school/club team where a player came from, so it cannot be concluded that they both contributed two players of different positions. Therefore, the statement "of the three different position georgia and penn state contributed two of the same" is refuted by the table.
706	Supported. According to the table, after 2000, four players representing four different nationalities were added to the Utah Jazz all-time roster. These players were John Amaechi from England, Louis Amundson from the United States, Rafael Araujo from Brazil, and Carlos Arroyo from Puerto Rico. Therefore, the statement "after 2000 England, the United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico each contributed one player" is supported by the table.
707	Supported. According to the table, out of the 9 players mentioned, 7 of them were from the United States, while the remaining two were from England and Brazil. Therefore, the statement "the United States contributed the most players of all the countries" is supported by the table.
708	Refuted. According to the table, after 1985, the United States contributed more than four players for the Utah Jazz all-time roster. Additionally, Louis Amundson is not listed as the most recent player from the United States, since several players listed after him on the table, including Shandon Anderson, Carlos Arroyo, and Anthony Avent, are also from the United States and have played for the Utah Jazz after Louis Amundson. Therefore, the statement "after 1985, the United States contributed four players with Louis Amundson being the most recent" is refuted by the table.
709	The statement is not sufficiently supported, and cannot accurately be determined with the current information in the table. While there are several players listed in the table with their nationality being from the United States, the statement does not specify if the number of United States players refers to only those born in the United States or also includes players with dual citizenship or naturalization. Therefore, without further information on the criteria for how United States players are defined, it cannot be accurately determined from the table whether the Utah Jazz had three players from the United States.
710	Refuted. While the table does include players from Georgia and Penn State, it does not explicitly state that these schools contributed a center and a guard. Furthermore, the table only includes one player (Shandon Anderson) from Georgia, and he is listed as a guard/forward, not strictly a guard. Similarly, the table only includes one player (John Amaechi) from Penn State, and he is listed as a center/forward, not strictly a guard. Therefore, the statement "of the three different positions , georgia and penn state contributed a center and a guard" is not supported by the table.
711	Supported. According to the table, after 2000, only two countries are represented in the Utah Jazz roster with one player each; Brazil (Rafael Araújo) and England (John Amaechi). Therefore, the statement "after 2000, only Brazil and England contributed one player to the Utah Jazz" is supported by the table.
712	Refuted. According to the table, only one player, John Amaechi, is listed as being from England. Therefore, the statement "of all the countries, England contributed the most players of all the countries" is refuted by the table.
713	Supported. According to the table, after 1985, there were two players from the United States, J J Anderson and Louis Amundson, and the most recent player was Rafael Araujo, who was from Brazil and played for the Jazz during the 2006-2007 season. Therefore, the statement "after 1985, the United States contributed two players with Rafael Araujo being the most recent" is supported by the table.
714	Refuted. The table shows that "Arienai Kisu" was broadcasted 7 days after the episode with the earliest broadcast date – "Omae ga Hosii". Therefore, the statement "arienai kisu was broadcasted 7 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date" is not supported by the table.
715	Refuted. The episode with the earliest broadcast date is "omae ga hosii" with a rating of 22.4%.

911	Partially supported. Annika Sörenstam won the Women's British Open in 2003 with a score of 278, which was the lowest number of strokes, as mentioned in the table. However, Yani Tseng did not win with the lowest number of strokes. In 2011, Yani Tseng won with a score of 272, which was not the lowest overall score (Jeong Jang had a score of 272 in 2005), but it was the lowest score to par (-16), which means she had the best score relative to the difficulty of the course. Therefore, the statement "Annika Sörenstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest number of strokes" is partially supported by the table.
912	Partially supported. Yani Tseng was indeed the runner-up in 2008 and the champion in 2010 and 2011, according to the table. However, there is no mention of her in any other year in the table. Therefore, the statement "Yani Tseng was the runner up in 2008 and became the champion in 2010 and 2011" is partially supported by the table.
913	Supported. According to the table, Se Ri Pak won the Women's British Open in 2001 and finished as the runner-up in the tournament two years after in 2003. Therefore, the statement "Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001, then came 2nd place two years after" is supported by the table.
914	Supported. According to the table, Jiyai Shin from South Korea became the champion in the 2012 Women's British Open held at Royal Liverpool Golf Club. She won with a score of 279 and was 9 strokes ahead of the runner-up, Inbee Park. Therefore, the statement "Jiyal Shin became champion by beating Inbee Park in the 2012 open with 9 strokes" is supported by the table.
915	Refuted. According to the table, Jiyai Shin won the 2012 Women's British Open and earned a winner's share of £428,650. However, the winner's share for Yani Tseng in 2011 is not given in the table. Hence, the statement "in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned 36517 more than Yani Tseng in 2011" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
916	Partially supported. Annika Sörenstam won the Women's British Open in 2003, but Catriona Matthew's win is not the lowest number of strokes according to the table. Hence, the statement "Annika Sörenstam and Catriona Matthew won with the lowest number of strokes" is not entirely accurate.
917	Refuted. According to the table, Karrie Webb was the runner-up in 2008 and Jiyai Shin was the champion for that year. Additionally, Yani Tseng became the champion in both 2010 and 2011, whereas Karrie Webb did not win either of those years. Therefore, the statement "Karrie Webb was the runner up in 2008 and became the champion in 2010 and 2011" is refuted by the table.
918	Supported. According to the table, Se Ri Pak from South Korea was the champion in the 2001 Women's British Open with a score of 277, and two years after in 2003, she came in second place, losing to Annika Sörenstam by only one stroke. Therefore, the statement "Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001, then came 2nd place two years after" is supported by the table.
919	Refuted. The statement is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, Jiyai Shin did not win the 2010 Women's British Open, Yani Tseng won by a margin of 1 stroke over Katherine Hull. Secondly, Inbee Park was not the runner-up in the 2010 Women's British Open, it was Katherine Hull. Therefore, the statement "jiyal shin became champion by beating inbee park in the 2010 open with 9 strokes" is refuted by the table.
920	Refuted. There is no information about Yani Tseng earning a specific amount of money during the 2011 Women's British Open in the given table. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the amount of money earned by Jiyai Shin in 2012 with that of Yani Tseng in 2011.
921	Supported. According to the table, the Dolphins won 12 games and lost 4 games during the regular season of the 1983 season. Therefore, the statement "the Dolphins finished the regular season with a 12-4 record" is supported by the table.

923	Supported. According to the table, the Dolphins won 9 of their final 10 games in the 1983 season from Week 7 through Week 16, with their only loss during that span being to the New England Patriots in Week 11. Therefore, the statement "9 of the Dolphins final 10 games were victories" is supported by the table.
924	Refuted. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins scored 38 points or more in three games: week 6 against the Buffalo Bills (lost 35-38), week 12 against the Baltimore Colts (won 37-0), and week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals (won 38-14). Therefore, the statement "the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game was 38" is not accurate since the Dolphins scored more than 38 points in at least two games.
925	Supported. According to the table, the lowest attendance figure for a game during the 1983 Miami Dolphins season was 32343, which was for the game against the Baltimore Colts on October 23, 1983. Therefore, the statement "the lowest attendance figure for a game was 32343" is supported by the table.

927	Refuted. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins won 9 out of their last 10 games in the 1983 season. There was a loss against the New England Patriots on November 13, 1983 (Week 11). Therefore, the statement "the Dolphins' final 10 games were victories" is refuted by the table.
928	False. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins scored more than 34 points in three different games during the 1983 season, specifically in Week 2 against the New England Patriots (winning 34-24), Week 9 against the Los Angeles Rams (winning 30-14), and Week 16 against the New York Jets (winning 34-14). Therefore, the statement "the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game was 34 points" is false.
929	Supported. According to the table, during the 1983 Dolphins season, the lowest attendance figure for a game was 39434, which was for the game against the Houston Oilers in Week 14. Therefore, the statement "the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins' game was 39434" is supported by the table.
930	Refuted. According to the table, the scores for the Minnesota Wild games on February 27 and February 29 during the 2007-08 season were different. The score on February 27 was 3-2 in favor of Minnesota, while the score on February 29 was also 3-2, but this time again in favor of Minnesota's opponent (Florida). So the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29" is refuted by the table.
931	Partially supported. According to the table, the score on February 10th during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season was 2-1, which supports the statement. However, the score on February 24th was 2-1 in favor of Calgary Flames and not for Minnesota Wild, which refutes the statement. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score on February 10 and February 24 was 2-1" is partially supported by the table.
932	Refuted. According to the table, the match on February 12 was won by Edmonton (4-2) with Harding as the goaltender for Minnesota, whereas the match on February 20 was won by Chicago (3-0) with Harding as the goaltender for Minnesota again. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the match on February 12 and February 20 both had the same decision" is refuted by the table.
933	Refuted. The table shows that the Minnesota Wild played 7 home games (February 5, 7, 9, 14, 17, 24, 26) and 8 away games (February 2, 10, 12, 20, 27, 29). Therefore, Minnesota played one fewer home game than away games in February 2008. The statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota played home two times less than they played away" is refuted by the table.
934	Supported. According to the table, the decision (meaning the goaltender who was credited with the win) for the Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season was Backstrom 8 times and Harding 3 times. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision was Backstrom eleven times more than it was Harding" is supported by the table.
935	Refuted. According to the table, Minnesota won both games on February 27 and February 29 during the 2007-08 season. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lost by more than 2 on February 27 and February 29" is not supported by the table.
936	Refuted. According to the table, the score on February 10th was 2-1 in favor of Minnesota, and the score on February 24th was also a one-goal difference with a score of 2-1 in favor of Calgary. Hence, the difference in the score on these two dates was only one goal, and it was not more than two. Therefore, the statement "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the difference in the score on February 10 and February 24 was more than 2" is refuted by the table.
937	Refuted. According to the table, the match on February 12 was between Minnesota and Edmonton, and the score was 2-4, while the match on February 20 was between Minnesota and Chicago and the score was 0-3.

944	Refuted. Although the Detroit Lions beat the Green Bay Packers twice during the 1976 season (week 4 and week 8), according to the table, the lowest point total the Packers scored in a game against the Lions was 14 (week 12). Therefore, the statement "the Packers scored the least amount of points (6) in a game versus the Lions" is refuted by the table.
945	Refuted. According to the table, the Lions finished the 1976 season with a record of 6 wins and 8 losses. Therefore, the statement "the Lions finished with a record of 4 wins and 8 losses" is refuted by the table.

949	Refuted. The Packers did win 2 games against the Lions during the 1976 season, but the highest amount of points they scored in a game against the Lions was not 6. In fact, the Packers scored 24 points against the Lions in the week 4 match-up (October 3, 1976), which is the second highest number of points they scored against the Lions in the season. Therefore, the statement "the packers scored the highest amount of points (6) in a game versus the lions" is refuted by the table.
950	Supported. According to the table, the Wildcats were able to keep their opposition scoreless in four games. Specifically, in games 2, 3, 4, and 5, the opposing teams (Cincinnati, Xavier, Georgia, and Vanderbilt) were not able to score any points while the Wildcats won those games. Therefore, the statement "the Wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in four games" is supported by the table.
951	Supported. According to the table, the maximum points that the Kentucky Wildcats scored in any game they lost was 7. Therefore, the statement "the wildcats never scored more than 7 in any game they lost" is supported by the table.
952	Supported. According to the table, the Wildcats lost one game in September (game 1), and two games in November (game 7 and game 10), which confirms that the statement "the Wildcats lost one game in September and two games in November" is supported by the table.

For instance, they scored 20, 26, 14, and 36 points in their wins against Cincinnati, Georgia, Vanderbilt, and Evansville respectively.

957	Supported. According to the table, the Wildcats lost one game in November (game 7) and two games in September (game 1 and game 7). Therefore, the statement "the Wildcats loss one game in November and two games in September" is supported by the table.
958	Partially supported. According to the table provided, the Kentucky Wildcats did play two games in November as mentioned in the statement. However, they played three games (not four) in September, and three games (not two) in October. So, the statement "the wildcats played four games in September, two games in October, and two games in November" is only partially supported by the table.
959	Supported. According to the table, during the 1947 season, the Wildcats outscored their opponent by a maximum of 26 points in their game against Georgia, where they won 26-0. Therefore, the statement "the most the Wildcats outscored an opponent is by 26 points" is supported by the table.
960	Partially supported. The table shows that there are a total of five different constructors and the number of times they appear in the table are as follows: Ford appears 11 times, Ferrari appears 3 times, Lotus appears 2 times, March appears 4 times, and Matra appears 1 time.Therefore, the statement "there are more Fords than any other with Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least" is partially supported since Ford is indeed the most common constructor in the table, but Alfa Romeo is not mentioned at all. Also, Matra is tied with other constructors, so it cannot be said that Matra has the least appearance in the table.
961	Refuted. The table provides information on the reason for retirement/withdrawal from the race, but there is no clear evidence to support that 'engine trouble' was the most common issue. From the table, there were several reasons for retirement (such as accident, physical issues, gearbox, etc.), so it cannot be concluded that engine trouble was the most common issue. Therefore, the statement "oh the issue affecting time engine trouble is the most common" is refuted by the table.
962	Supported. According to the table, Alex Soler-Roig has the highest position on the grid at 25 followed by Howden Ganley at 24. Jackie Stewart is in the 1st position. Therefore, the statement "Alex Soler-Roig has the highest position at 25 on grid following Howden Ganley at 24 with Jackie Stewart in the 1st position" is supported by the table.
963	Refuted. According to the table, there is no four-way tie for the most laps at 79. Mario Andretti, Jackie Stewart, Clay Regazzoni, and Reine Wisell completed all 79 laps, which is the highest number of laps. However, there is no two-way tie for the least amount of laps at 5. Jo Bonnier and Alex Soler - Roig completed only 5 laps each, which is the lowest number of laps. Therefore, the statement "there is a four-way tie for the most laps at 79 with a two-way tie for the least amount at 5" is refuted by the table.
964	Refuted. The table shows that there are two drivers, Emerson Fittipaldi and Jo Bonnier, who completed fewer than 75 laps, and their reason for not finishing the race is listed in the table as an engine failure and a suspension failure, respectively. Therefore, the statement "any driver below 75 laps care trouble of some kind thus no time listed" is not supported by the table.
965	Partially supported. There were three BRM cars that participated in the race (driven by Hill, Ganley, and Rodriguez), which is more than the number of cars from any other single constructor. However, the statement regarding the number of cars from other constructors is not entirely clear. Both Alfa Romeo and Matra had one car each (de Adamich for Alfa Romeo, and Amon for Matra), which ties them as the two constructors with the least number of cars in the race. Therefore, partially the statement is supported by the table.
966	Refuted. The table does not support this statement. There were three different issues that affected drivers during the race: engine trouble, suspension trouble, and overheating. While suspension trouble affected one driver, engine trouble was the most common issue affecting five drivers during the race. Therefore, the statement "oh the issue affecting time suspension trouble is the most common" is not supported.
967	Refuted. According to the table, Dave Charlton was not in the first position on the grid. Also, John Love had the lowest position at 21 on the grid, while Howden Ganley had a higher position at 24 and Dave Charlton had a higher position at 16.

There is no mention of any driver completing exactly 75 laps. Also, there are two drivers mentioned in the table who completed only 5 laps each, namely Jo Bonnier and Alex Soler-Roig, and no driver completed only 7 laps. Therefore, the statement "there is a four way tie for the most laps at 75 with a two way tie for the least amount at 7" is refuted by the table.
969	Refuted. The statement is not supported by the table. While it is true that some drivers retired before completing the full number of laps (due to various reasons such as mechanical issues, accidents, etc.), the table clearly shows that the laps completed and time taken (or reason for retirement) is listed for all drivers. There is no driver above 75 laps that does not have a time or reason for retirement listed.
970	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one club from the South American continent which is "Team Brazil" but "Team Brazil" is not a football club but a team representing a nation. Hence, it cannot be concluded that "Team Brazil" is the only football club located on the South American continent.
971	Refuted. According to the table, there are two football clubs associated with Oceania: Team New Zealand and Team Australia. Therefore, the statement "Team Australia is the only football club located in Oceania" is refuted by the table.

Therefore, the statement "Team Brazil, Team Australia, and Team England are three of the clubs that participated in the 2011 season" is only partially supported by the table.
975	Refuted. According to the table, "Team Brazil" is not a football club, but a racing team. Also, it is mentioned that it represents the continent of South America, not Europe.

The unspecified population percentage of 0.0034% is not applicable to this age group as it refers to "unspecified" race/ethnicity, not ages. Therefore, the statement "the Brazil population of 100% for ages 15 - 17 is with unspecified 0.0034% of 321 is 10 357 874" is partly incorrect.

1283	The statement is not supported or refuted by the table. There is no driver or constructor on the grid at position 5 who completed 34 laps or more. The table shows the number of laps completed by each driver in the race along with their position on the grid, but there is no information about the number of laps completed for each position on the grid.
1284	The statement is unclear as it is written. However, assuming that the statement means "Christian Danner completed the least number of laps (3) when starting from the 5th position on the grid", then the statement is supported by the table.

1307	Supported. According to the table, the episode with the production code 208 is "Rocket's Descent", which is the 9th episode of the series. As the statement refers to the series number and not the episode number, it is important to note that Episode 9 (with the production code 208) belongs to the second series of the show. Therefore, the statement "series number 8 had a production code of 208" is supported by the table.
1308	Supported. According to the table, episode 28 is titled "The Suspension". Therefore, the statement "episode 28 is titled The Suspension" is supported by the table.

It does not provide any information beyond that time frame or about the events taking place in New York City apart from 1984 and 1985 New York City Marathon. So, the statement that "the New York City Marathon in 1985 was the latest year a competition was held in New York City" cannot be concluded from the given table.
1316	Supported. According to the table, Orlando Pizzolato won the Venice Marathon held in Venice, Italy in the year 1988 with a timing of 2:15:24. Therefore, the statement "Venice, Italy was the venue for notes 2:15:24" is supported by the table.

1438	Refuted. According to the table, the total life expectancy in 1950 - 1955 was 50.9 (for both males and females) which is less than 70.1.

The CDR of 22.6 can be seen in the period of 1980-1985 when the number of deaths per year was 1,064,000.

Therefore, the statement "there are 3 624 000 live births per year in the period from 1975 to 1980" is refuted by the table.
1444	The statement is contradictory and cannot be evaluated.

Therefore, the statement is self-contradicting and cannot be evaluated based on the table.

Josã Ortiz attended Oregon State and played for the Jazz from 1988-1990, which means the statement "Greg Ostertag went to Oregon State and played for the Jazz from 1988-90" is refuted by the table.
1452	Refuted. According to the table, Andre Owens played as a guard for the Jazz during the 2005-06 season. Therefore, the statement "Andre Owens played center for the jazz from 2005 - 06" is refuted by the information in the table as the correct position played by Andre Owens is a guard.
1453	The statement needs to be corrected. The table shows that the Utah Jazz had a guard named Andre Owens from the United States, who played for them in 2005-06. There is no player from Turkey or from Houston who played for the Jazz during that time. Therefore, the statement "the Jazz had a Houston graduate from Turkey play for them from 2005-06" is not supported by the table.
1454	Refuted. According to the table, Dan O'Sullivan attended Fordham and played the center position for the Utah Jazz during the 1990-91 season. Kansas and the center position are not mentioned alongside Dan O'Sullivan's name in the table.

1455	Supported. According to the table, Mehmet Okur's position during his time at Efes Pilsen (Turkey) was "forward-center." Therefore, the statement "the position was center in the club team of Efes Pilsen (Turkey)" is supported by the table.
1456	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one row with a gb of 5, which is row 34 (2010 season). The win percentage of the 2010 season was 535, but this information alone is not enough to calculate the average win percentage of seasons with a gb of 5 since there is only one such season in the table.
1457	It is not possible to determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table, as there is no mention of a gb (games behind) value of 5 in the table. Therefore, there are no records available to calculate the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5.
1458	Refuted. There are a few rows in the table with a win percentage above .553 and a gb of less than 5, such as rows 29, 30, 31, 33, and 34. Therefore, the statement that ".553 is the average win percentage of a season without a gb of 5" is not supported by the table.
1459	Refuted. The table does not provide enough information to calculate the average win percentage of a season with a gap (gb) of 5. Additionally,  the table does not have a row with a win percentage of 0.535 and a gap of 5 during the 2011 season.

The table only states that he was a Democratic representative who was re-elected in 1974. Therefore, the statement "Sidney R. Yates of Illinois 10 was elected as an incumbent from the Republican Party in 1964" is refuted by the table.

1466	There seems to be an error in the statement as "volume 5, of 4 episodes" is not possible. As each volume in the table has 4 episodes, it cannot have a volume with 5 episodes. Please provide a corrected statement for me to determine whether it is supported or refuted by the table.
1467	Supported. According to the table, every volume has only one disc which is mentioned in row 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the statement "the highest number of discs released for any of the volumes is only 1" is supported by the table.

1473	Refuted. According to the table, all volumes have 1 disc each. Additionally, each row in the table lists 4 episodes for each corresponding volume. Therefore, the statement "the volume's 2, 4, and 5 have 2 discs and 3 episodes" is not supported by the table.
1474	Refuted. According to the table, the region 1 episode that aired in September is from the 5th volume and aired on September 19, 2006. On the other hand, the region 2 episode from the 5th volume aired on May 26, 2008, which is almost two years after the region 1 episode. Therefore, the statement "the region 1 episode that aired in September aired in region 2 earlier" is refuted by the table.
1475	Supported. According to the table, the "discs" column has a value of 1 for each row, which means each volume has only one disc. Therefore, the statement "there is more than one disc" is not supported, and its negation "there is only one disc" is supported.
1476	Refuted. According to the table, there is no mention of March 15, 2007 in any of the regions. However, for region 2, the highest number of episodes for any release is 4, which occurred on June 4, 2007. Therefore, the statement "on March 15, 2007, and in region 2 the highest number of episodes is 3" is refuted by the table.
1477	Supported. As per the table, in 1996, VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 24-9 and was placed in the Southeast region. Therefore, the statement "in 1996, the southeast region had a record of 24-9" is supported by the table.
1478	Refuted. The statement about the highest number of wins in a year is incorrect because wins and losses are not reflected in the record that is given in the table. The record is simply the number of wins and losses in a given season. In this case, the 2011 season achieved the highest number of wins with 28, followed by 2012 with 29 wins. However, the 2012 season also had 7 losses, and the 2013 season had 9 losses. Therefore, the statement "2012 set the record for the year with the highest score of 29-7. 2013 followed with 27-9" is not supported by the table.
1479	Supported. According to the table, during the 2011 season, the VCU Rams Men's Basketball team had a record of 28 - 12, and they were in the southwest region. The team won a total of 5 games (w 59-46, w 74-56, w 94-76, w 72-71 OT, and w 71-61) and lost only 1 game (l 62-70) during the tournament. Therefore, the statement "in 2011, the southwest region won a total of 5 games and lost 1 game creating a record of 28 - 12" is supported by the table.
1480	Supported. According to the table, in 1980, VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 18-12, seeded at 12th position in the east region, and their result was a loss of 72-86. Also, the year 1980 was smaller than 1996. Therefore, the statement "in 1980, the east region results were a loss of 72-86 from a seed 12 plus the year was smaller than 1996" is supported by the table.
1481	Supported. According to the table, the first year with a record of 18-12 was 1980, as shown in row 2. Therefore, the statement "the earliest year with a record of 18-12 was the year 1980" is supported by the table.
1482	Refuted. According to the table, the best record listed is 28-12 in the 2011 season, not 29-7. The 2012 season records show a 29-7 record but they only got a 12 seed, not 5 seed. Therefore, the statement "the best record listed is 29 - 7, in 2012, when they received a 5 seed" is not entirely correct based on the information in the table.
1483	Refuted. The results "w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70" refer to the VCU Rams men's basketball team's performance in the 2011 season. However, the record associated with these results is not mentioned in the table. The record of 27 - 9 is associated with the VCU Rams men's basketball team's performance in the 2013 season. Hence, the statement "w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 i 62 - 70 results has the record of 27 - 9" is refuted by the table.
1484	Refuted. According to the table, the only instance where "l 72-86" appears under the "results" column is during the 1980 season, where the Rams had a seed of 12, not less than 12. Therefore, the statement "l 72 - 86 results has a seed less than 12 and a year that's larger than 1996" is refuted by the table.
1485	Refuted. According to the table, in 1980, VCU Rams finished with a record of 18-12, but the seed they received was 12 and not 11. Therefore, the statement "in 1980 they finished with a record of 18 - 12 and received the 11 seed" is refuted by the table.
1486	Refuted. According to the table, in 1996, VCU Rams Men's Basketball team was the 12th seed of the Southeast region, not the 2nd seed. Therefore, the statement "in 1996 they were the 2 seed of the southeast region" is refuted by the table.

1489	Refuted. As per the table, the earliest year when the "result" is nominated and "role/episode" is "Fox Mulder" is 1997 (row 5), not 1996. In 1996, David Duchovny won the award for "Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series" for his role as Fox Mulder, while Gillian Anderson was nominated for "Best Actress in a Leading Role - Drama Series" for her role as Dana Scully.
1490	Refuted. According to the table, there is no mention of any role/episode being David Duchovny in 1998. The table only mentions nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role - Drama Series for Gillian Anderson in 1998.

The table only provides information on the players' debut year, current club, goals and appearance, but does not provide information on the number of goals they scored in their debut year.

1872	Partially supported. According to the table, the teams with 6 wins have blank ends ranging from 10-18, and the lowest value is 10 which corresponds to British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. However, there is no mention of any team having a blank end value of 10 when they have won 6 games. Therefore, the statement "10 is the lowest value of blank ends when the win (w) is 6" is partially supported as a team with 6 wins (ranked 6th, 7th, and 9th in the table) have a blank end value of 10, which is the lowest among those teams.
1873	Partially supported. Looking at the table, we see that the team to have exactly 9 blank ends is Newfoundland and Labrador, and their corresponding value for ends lost is 45. So the statement is not supported as 48 is not the value of ends lost when the blank ends is 9, but the value of ends lost appears in the table for another number of blank ends.
1874	The statement is not supported or refuted by the table. The table shows the number of wins, losses, points for (pf), points against (pa), ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot percentage for each team in the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. However, there is no information in the table about the relationship between pf and ends lost that would allow us to confirm or refute the statement "67 is the pf when ends lost is 40".
1875	Refuted. The table does not provide evidence to support the statement about the occurrence of 83% for a specific condition where the value of the "blank ends" column equals 8.

There is also no information in the table about the total of all "shot pct" occurrences when the value of "blank ends" is equal to any specific value.
1876	Refuted. Based on the table, we can see that Randy Ferbey was the skip of Alberta and their win-loss record was 9-2. However, the statement "Alberta is the locale when l is 9" is not supported by the table since there is no information about what "l" stands for.
1877	Refuted. According to the table, the value of blank ends is 7 when the stolen ends are 9 (for Alberta). There is no row in the table where the stolen ends have a value of 7. Therefore, the statement "46 is the value of blank ends when stolen ends is 7" is refuted by the table.
1878	Unsupported. There is no row in the table where the value of Blank Ends is 9. The highest value of Blank Ends is 18 in row 6. Therefore, the statement "46 is the value of ends lost when blank ends is 9" is unsupported by the table.
