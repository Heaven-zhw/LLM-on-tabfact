1	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, "The Witchfinder" is the seventh episode of Merlin series 2 and "Sweet Dreams" is the tenth episode, which means that "The Witchfinder" episode happens later in the series than "Sweet Dreams".
2	The statement "David Moore directed three episodes of series 2 of Merlin" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, David Moore directed episode 14 "The Curse of Cornelius Sigan," episode 17 "Lancelot and Guinevere," and episode 18 "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" of series 2 of Merlin.
3	The statement "the lady of the lake episode had the most UK viewers" is supported by the table. According to the table, episode 9, "The Lady of the Lake," had 6.3 million UK viewers, which is the highest number of viewers for any episode of Merlin (Series 2) listed in the table.
4	The statement "Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode of series 2" is supported by the table. As per the table, Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode in series 2, which is "Sweet Dreams" (Row 11).
5	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Beauty and the Beast (Part 1) had 5.53 million UK viewers, while Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) had 6.14 million UK viewers. Therefore, Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) had more UK viewers than Beauty and the Beast (Part 1) as stated in the statement.
6	The statement that "the sweet dreams episode happens earlier in the series than the witchfinder" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the witchfinder episode (Episode 7) aired on November 7, 2009, while the Sweet Dreams episode (Episode 10) aired on November 28, 2009. Therefore, sweet dreams episode happened later in the series than the witchfinder episode.
7	The statement "David Moore directed five episodes of series 2 of Merlin" is not supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that David Moore directed only three episodes out of the twelve episodes in series 2 of Merlin. Hence, the statement is refuted by the table.
8	Based on the information in the provided table, the statement "the lady of the lake episode had the least UK viewers" is actually refuted. In fact, the "The Curse of Cornelius Sigan" episode had the lowest UK viewership with 5.77 million viewers, while "The Lady of the Lake" episode had 6.3 million UK viewers.
9	The statement "Lucy Watkins only wrote six episodes of series 2" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode ("Sweet Dreams") of series 2, while other writers such as Howard Overman and Julian Jones wrote two episodes each. Therefore, the statement that Lucy Watkins wrote six episodes is not supported by the information in the table.
10	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, "beauty and the beast (part 1)" had 5.53 million viewers in the UK, while "beauty and the beast (part 2)" had 6.14 million viewers in the UK. Therefore, "beauty and the beast (part 2)" had more UK viewers than "beauty and the beast (part 1)".
11	I'm sorry, but the table does not provide information about the number of goals scored per player for the 2008-09 r.s.c. Anderlecht season. Therefore, I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the information presented in the table.
12	I am sorry, but the given table does not provide sufficient information to confirm or refute the given statement about Jonathan Legear and Matias Suarez. The table only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the league, in the title playoff, and in the super cup. It does not provide information about their performance in the Belgian Cup or any comparison between the players in terms of their performance in that competition.
13	I'm sorry, but the table you provided does not provide information about the Belgian Cup scoring. It only provides information about the league, title playoff, and Super Cup. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
14	I'm sorry, but I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table as it does not provide any information about the players' performances in the UEFA Champions League tournament. The table only shows the players' statistics in the league, playoffs, and super cup tournaments.
15	The statement presented is incorrect when compared to the table provided. The table shows that the player with the highest number of goals for the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season is Mbark Boussoufa with a total of 11 goals scored in the league play and title playoff. Matias Suarez is not the top scorer as mentioned in the statement, Suarez scored only 1 goal in the league and 1 goal in the super cup for a total of 2 goals. Therefore, the table refutes the statement and shows that the top scorer, Mbark Boussoufa, has a total of 11 goals scored, which is higher than the scorer with the next highest goal tally (Tom De Sutter with 9 goals).
16	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information provided in the table. The table only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, super cup, and the total number of goals for the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season. It does not provide any information about which league each player belongs to or how many players scored three goals. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is true or false based on the information in the table.
17	I apologize, but I am unable to support or refute the statement you provided with the table as it does not contain information about the number of goals scored by the players in the Belgian Cup. The table only displays the number of goals scored in the league, title playoff, and super cup. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if Thomas Chatelle scored four more goals than Matias Suarez in the Belgian Cup using this table.
18	I'm sorry, but I cannot determine whether the statement "of the four players who played in the Belgian Cup, Lucas Biglia scored more goals than the other players combined" is supported or refuted by the table provided, as the table only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the League, Title Playoff, and Super Cup competitions, but does not indicate the performance of the players in the Belgian Cup specifically. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether the statement is true or false based on the provided table.
19	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not contain any information regarding the UEFA Champions League tournament, so it cannot support or refute the statement about Jelle Van Damme's performance in that competition. The table only provides data on the number of goals scored by individual players in the Belgian First Division A league, title playoff, and the Belgian Super Cup during the 2008-09 season for R.S.C. Anderlecht team.
20	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided as it only displays the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoffs, super cup, and altogether, but does not provide information about the total number of goals scored by each player throughout the season, nor the ranking of the players based on their total goals scored. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the top scorer (Matias Suarez) has 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor based on the information in the table alone.
21	The statement is supported by the table. There are four people who tied for ninth place, and three of them are from the United States (Scott Simpson, Peter Jacobsen, and Hubert Green).
22	The statement cannot be completely supported or refuted by the information provided in the table as the table only gives the nationality, score, and placement of the players. However, we can analyze the table to get an idea of how many players scored under par and what proportion of those players were from the United States.Looking at the table, we can see that only two players had a score under par (-2 and -1), and both of those players were from the United States. However, it's worth noting that there were nine players who scored even par or better (including the two players who scored under par), and five of those players were from the United States. Therefore, while it's true that all of the players who scored under par were from the United States, we cannot say that a majority of players who scored under par or even par were from the United States based on the information provided in the table.
23	The statement is supported by the table. Masashi Ozaki, the only player from Japan in the tournament, scored a total of 281 which is the same as Scott Simpson. Therefore, the average score for players from Japan is 281.
24	Based on the information provided in the table for the 1989 US Open (golf), the statement "there are a total of four countries represented by the players" is supported. The table shows that players from four countries competed in the tournament: the United States, Wales, Japan, and Spain.
25	The statement "the most amount of money won by someone from Wales is 67823" is supported by the table as Ian Woosnam, who is from Wales, tied for second place with a score of -1 and won $67,823.
26	That statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 6, we see that Brian Claar, who is tied for fifth place, is from the United States.
27	The statement cannot be verified by the table alone since it only gives scores and nationalities of players from the top 13 positions. However, of the 13 players listed in the table, 8 are from the United States and had a mix of scores, some above par and some under par. It's worth noting that the table does not include all players who participated in the 1989 U.S. Open, and therefore, a conclusion about the nationalities of players who scored over par cannot be made from the limited data in the table.
28	The statement that "the average score for players from Japan is 251" is refuted by the table. There is only one player from Japan listed in the table, Masashi Ozaki, who is ranked tied for sixth place with a score of 281, not 251. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
29	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that there are four countries represented by the players: United States, Wales, Japan, and Spain. Therefore, the statement that "there are a total of five countries represented by the players" is false.
30	I'm sorry, but the statement "the most amount of money won by someone from Wales is 46823" cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. The table only shows the scores, rankings, and prize money for 13 of the top players in the 1989 U.S. Open golf tournament, but it does not specifically indicate the amount of money won by players from Wales in any other tournament. Therefore, there is no way to confirm or deny this statement based on the given table.
31	The statement "except for Slovakia, all other countries are from North America" is supported by the table. As per the table, all the players except for Ladislav Scurko, who is from Slovakia, are from either the United States or Canada, which are both North American countries. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
32	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, there are five players from the United States and five players from Canada, which means that there are an equal number of players from both countries. This confirms that there are five players from the United States and Canada each in the 2004 - 05 Philadelphia Flyers season.
33	The statement is supported by the table. The table lists the players in the 2004 - 05 Philadelphia Flyers season and the college/junior/club team (league) they played for. As we can see in the table, all players attended different colleges, junior teams, or club teams (leagues). Therefore, the statement that no two players attended the same college/junior/club team (league) is supported by the information presented in the table.
34	The statement is supported by the table. Only round 3 is listed once, while all other rounds (4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) have two players listed.
35	The statement "Triston Grant is the only player listed for left wing" is supported by the table. As per row 11 of the table, Triston Grant is listed as the only player for left wing on the Philadelphia Flyers' roster for the 2004-05 season.
36	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. None of the players listed in the table are from Norway. The player from outside the United States and Canada listed in the table is Ladislav Scurko, who is from Slovakia.
37	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the number of players from Canada outnumber the number of players from the United States" is supported. There are a total of 11 players in the table, out of which 6 players are from Canada and 5 players are from the United States. Therefore, there are more players from Canada in this table than from the United States.
38	The statement "every player came from either a college program or a junior/club team" is supported by the information in the table. Each player's background is listed in the "college / junior / club team" column, and all of them are either from a college program of some level or a junior/club team. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
39	The statement "two players were drafted in each round between rounds 3 and 9" is refuted by the table. The table shows that there were different numbers of players draft in each round between rounds 3 and 9:- Round 3 had one player (Rob Bellamy) drafted- Round 4 had two players (R.J. Anderson and David Laliberte) drafted- Round 5 had two players (Chris Zarb and Gino Pisellini) drafted- Round 6 had two players (Ladislav Scurko and Frederik Cabana) drafted- Round 8 had two players (Martin Houle and Travis Gawryletz) drafted- Round 9 had two players (Triston Grant and John Carter) draftedTherefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
40	The statement is supported by the table. Triston Grant, who was drafted in the 9th round, is listed as playing the position of "left wing" in row 11 of the table. The other player drafted in the 9th round, John Carter, is listed as playing the position of "center" in row 12 of the table. Therefore, Triston Grant does not play the same position as the other player drafted in his round.
41	The statement "West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy beer had five awards between 1995 and 2009" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, "Good Old Boy" won a gold medal for "Best Bitter" at SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002, received a silver medal in the same category in 2005 at the same competition, and won a gold medal in the "in category" competition at Camra London and South East Regional Competition in 2009. Additionally, it was the overall winner of "Beer of the Festival" at CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival in 1995, and also became the second reserve champion in the "Overall" category at SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
42	The statement is not entirely correct. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer beer won two gold medals and one silver medal between 1995 and 2009. The beer won a gold medal for "Runner Up" in the "Beer of the Festival" category at the CAMRA Northamptonshire Branch Beer Festival in 1997, a silver medal for "Strong Ale" at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002, and a gold medal for "Best Local Beer" in the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival in both 2008 and 2009.
43	The statement "West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild was its most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, Maggs Magnificent Mild won multiple gold medals, silver medals, and a bronze medal in various competitions between 1995 and 2009. It also won the overall winner prize at the Bracknell Blues and Real Ale Festival in 2004. No other beer from the West Berkshire Brewery has won as many medals as Maggs Magnificent Mild during this period of time.
44	Based on the information in the table, the statement that "three of west berkshire brewery's beers each won a single award between 1995 and 2009" is refuted. The table shows that Good Old Boy won three awards, Maggs Magnificent Mild won eight awards, and Dr. Hexter's Healer won four awards. This means that at least three of West Berkshire Brewery's beers won a total of 15 awards between 1995 and 2009, which is more than the three awards suggested by the statement.
45	The statement is supported by the table. According to rows 6 and 9 of the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal in the mild and porter category at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, row 18 shows that Maggs Magnificent Mild won a silver medal in the mild category at the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2006. Therefore, the statement that the beer won an award two times at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2009 is true.
46	The statement "west berkshire brewery's Good Old Boy beer did not win a single award between 1995 and 2009" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Good Old Boy beer has won several awards, including the overall winner in the "Beer of the Festival" category at the CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival in 1995, a Gold medal for "Best Bitter" at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002, and a Silver medal for "Best Bitter" at the same competition in 2005. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
47	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer won a runner-up prize for Beer of the Festival at the 1997 CAMRA Northamptonshire Branch Beer Festival and a silver medal in the Strong Ale category at the 2002 SIBA South East Region Beer Competition. However, it also won a gold medal for Best Local Beer at the 2008 CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival and a gold medal for In Category at the 2009 CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition. Therefore, the statement that this specific beer has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009 is false.
48	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 6, 9, 12, 14, and 19, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal in every instance between the years 1995 and 2009 when it won a prize. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information in the table.
49	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is not accurate. While West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild did win two gold medals and a bronze medal in various categories at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition between 2002 and 2005, there is no mention of any awards received by the beer at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005. So, we can say that the statement is refuted by the table.
50	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 2, 3, and 9 all have the same attendance of 18,422 at the US Airways Center.
51	Looking at the table, we can see that the highest attendance recorded was at the American Airlines Center, where the Phoenix Suns played against the Dallas Mavericks on April 5th, 2009, and the attendance was 20,301. Therefore, the statement "the highest attendance was at the American Airlines Center" is supported by the table for the 2008-09 Phoenix Suns season.
52	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information provided in the table as it only lists the order of games by their dates and not their specific locations. It only shows that the Phoenix Suns played against the Memphis Grizzlies twice, on April 10 and April 13, in different locations. Similarly, it shows that the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves was played on April 11. However, it does not give any specific information about the order of those games.
53	The statement is refuted by the table. The game against New Orleans on April 8th had an attendance of 17,781, while the game against Minnesota on April 11th had an attendance of 18,478. Therefore, the game against Minnesota had a higher attendance than the game against New Orleans.
54	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the game against New Orleans didn't have the highest attendance" is supported. The game against Dallas, which was held on April 5th and is listed in row 4 of the table, had the highest attendance with 20,301 people. The game against New Orleans, which is listed in row 8, had an attendance of 17,781, which is lower than the attendance of the game against Dallas.
55	The statement that "Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans all had the same attendance" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the attendance for the games against Houston, Sacramento, and Memphis was the same, with 18,422 fans attending each game. The attendance for the game against New Orleans was 17,781, while the attendance for the game against Golden State is not provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans had the same attendance based on the information provided in this table.
56	The statement "the highest attendance was at the Target Center" is inaccurate and refuted by the table. The table shows that the highest attendance during the 2008-09 Phoenix Suns season was 20,301 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas during a game against the Mavericks on April 5th, 2009. The attendance for the game played at the Target Center against the Minnesota Timberwolves on April 11th, 2009, was 18,478, which is not the highest attendance. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
57	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The game against Memphis (row 6) at the FedExForum took place on April 10th, and the game against Minnesota (row 7) at the Target Center took place on April 11th, meaning that the game at FedExForum took place before the game at the Target Center.
58	The statement is refuted by the table. The attendance for the game against New Orleans on April 8th was 17,781, while the attendance for the game against Minnesota on April 11th was 18,478. Therefore, the game against Minnesota had a higher attendance than the game against New Orleans.
59	According to the table, the game against Dallas on April 5th had the highest attendance of 20,301. Therefore, the statement "the game against new orleans had the highest attendance" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
60	Yes, the statement "Emi Watanabe was ranked one place higher than Dagmar Lurz in the 1979 world figure skating championships" is supported by the information in the table. Emi Watanabe from Japan was ranked 3rd with a total of 180.52 points, whereas Dagmar Lurz from West Germany was ranked 4th with a total of 179.96 points. Thus, Watanabe was indeed ranked one place higher than Lurz in the competition.
61	The statement is supported by the table. The highest score in the table is 186.92, belonging to Linda Fratianne from the United States. The lowest score in the table is 112.28, belonging to Gloria Mas from Spain. The difference between these two scores is indeed 74.64 points.
62	The statement is supported by the table. Linda Fratianne from the United States is ranked as 1st, and Anett Pötzsch from East Germany is ranked as 2nd in the table for the 1979 world figure skating championships.
63	The statement is supported by the table. Bodil Olsson is listed as representing Sweden and received 23 points for her SP + FS, not 27.
64	The statement that "Natalia Strelkova is not the female losing the skating championship" is supported by the information in the table. Natalia Strelkova is listed as finishing in 13th place with a total of 164.94 points and a placing score of 134. Therefore she did not win the championship, but also did not "lose" the championship since only the top-ranked skater is considered the winner.
65	The statement is supported by the table. Emi Watanabe was ranked third in the 1979 world figure skating championships, as shown on row 4, while Dagmar Lurz was ranked fourth, as shown on row 5. So, Emi Watanabe was two places higher than Dagmar Lurz in the final ranking.
66	I apologize for the previous response. Based on the table, the statement "there was a 64.64 point difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (112.28)" is incorrect. The difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (112.28) is actually 74.64 points. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
67	The statement is refuted by the table. Linda Fratianne finished in first place, which is supported by row 2 where she is listed as rank 1. However, Anett Pötzsch managed to get in the top 3 by finishing in second place, as shown in row 3 where she is listed as rank 2 with a score of 184.36. Therefore, the statement that Anett Pötzsch didn't manage to get in the top 3 is refuted by the information in the table.
68	The statement "Natalia Strelkova came last with 112.28 points" is supported by the information in the table. As per row 13, Natalia Strelkova from the Soviet Union scored 164.94 points and placed 13th out of 31 skaters, which means she was not last. The skater who came in last place was Gloria Mas from Spain, who scored 112.28 points and placed 31st.
69	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Mark Cockerell from the United States finished in first place with a total score of 172.42 points, and Patrice Macrez from France finished in seventh place with a total score of 151.76 points. Therefore, Mark Cockerell received a higher score than Patrice Macrez, which means that the statement is correct.
70	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, two skaters from West Germany, Norbert Schramm and Stephan Bril, ranked fourth and sixth, respectively, at the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. However, neither of them won a medal, as the top three spots were taken by skaters from the United States, Japan, and Canada. Therefore, the statement that "West Germany had two of the top six but did not have anyone win a medal" is correct based on the given information in the table.
71	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 8 and row 9 of the table, we can see that Pierre Lamine from France (row 8) received a score of 150.5, while Shinji Someya from Japan (row 9) received a score of 150.34. The difference between their scores is only 0.16, which confirms the statement.
72	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Patrice Macrez representing France placed 7th with a total of 151.76 points and Pierre Lamine, also representing France, placed 8th with a total of 150.5 points. Thus, France's competitors finished in consecutive positions of 7th and 8th respectively.
73	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The score of the first-ranked skater, Mark Cockerell from the United States, was 172.42, while the score of the last-ranked skater, Jeremy Dowson from South Africa, was 114.98. The difference between these two scores is 57.44, which is close to the 58.04 stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
74	The statement is refuted by the table as Mark Cockerell finished with a higher score than Patrice Macrez. According to the table, Mark Cockerell of the United States finished in first place with a total of 172.42 points, while Patrice Macrez of France finished in seventh place with a total of 151.76 points. Therefore, "Mark Cockerell finished with a worse score than Patrice Macrez" is a false statement based on the information in the table.
75	The statement "West Germany had two of the top six and won a gold medal" is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Mark Cockerell from the United States won the gold medal, Takashi Mura from Japan won the silver medal, and Brian Pockar from Canada won the bronze medal. While Norbert Schramm from West Germany placed fourth and Stephan Bril from West Germany placed sixth, there is no indication that West Germany won the gold medal in the 1976 world junior figure skating championships.
76	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Shinji Someya scored 150.34 points, while Pierre Lamine scored 150.5 points. This means that Shinji Someya scored only 0.16 points less than Pierre Lamine. Therefore, Pierre Lamine did not beat Shinji Someya by more than a point.
77	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, France had two competitors in the competition, but neither of them finished better than 5th place. Patrice Macrez finished in 7th place with a total score of 151.76 (6th in the short program and 8th in the free skate), while Pierre Lamine finished in 8th place with a total score of 150.5 (8th in both the short program and free skate).
78	The statement is supported by the table. The difference between the points earned by the first-ranked skater, Mark Cockerell (172.42 points), and the last-ranked skater, Jeremy Dowson (114.98 points), is 57.44 points, which is less than 50 points. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
79	I'm sorry, but I cannot verify that statement using the provided table. The table only shows the scores for each game, but not the total points of the Detroit Red Wings or any other team. Additionally, the statement refers to the "highest visitor score," which is not clear whether it refers to a single game or the team's overall performance. Therefore, I cannot confirm or deny the statement using the provided table.
80	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is supported. The table shows that on January 5th, 2004, Detroit Red Wings scored 6 goals at a home game against the Nashville Predators, which was the highest home team score.
81	The statement is supported by the table as we can see in row 4 that on January 5, 2004, Detroit played against Nashville and won with a score of 6-0. This was indeed the highest score of the season for Detroit.
82	The statement appears to be supported by the table. There are six rows in the table where the attendance figure is listed as 20066, indicating that this was the highest attendance recorded for each of those six games. Therefore, it can be concluded that the highest attendances were 20066, occurring on 6 dates, as per the statement.
83	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the highest point gap was on January 5, with a spread of 6 points" is supported. On January 5, the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Nashville Predators with a score of 6-0, which gave them a total of 56 points (26-12-4-1), while the Predators remained with 50 points. Therefore, the point gap between the Red Wings and the Predators on January 5 was 6 points, which is the highest point gap in the table.
84	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table alone. The table only provides information about the scores of Detroit and its visiting opponents, but it doesn't include the scores of other NHL teams. Therefore, we cannot know if Detroit had one of the lowest visitor scores this season based on this table alone.
85	The table shows the scores of multiple games played by the Detroit Red Wings during the 2003-04 season, including their home games. However, it does not provide information on the scores of other home teams in the league, so it is not possible to determine if Detroit tied for the highest home team score based on the information presented in the table. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table alone.
86	The given table only provides information on the games played by the Detroit Red Wings in January 2004, but it does not give any cumulative statistics for the team's scoring during that period. Therefore, we cannot confirm or refute whether Detroit was the lowest scoring team by the end of January based on the information provided in the table alone.
87	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the low attendance rate of 20066 occurred multiple times" is supported. The attendance rate of 20066 appears in rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, and 14, indicating that it occurred at least 8 times during the 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season.
88	Based on the table, there is no direct evidence to support or refute this statement as it only provides information on the scores, attendance, and decision (whether the game was won or lost) for several games during the specified time period. In order to determine whether there was a tie for the largest point gap two times during the season, additional information would be needed on the point gaps for each game played throughout the entire season.
89	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Vilson Ahmeti's term as Prime Minister started on December 10, 1991, and Bashkim Fino's term as Prime Minister started on March 11, 1997, which is after Vilson Ahmeti's term start. Therefore, the statement that "the term start for Bashkim Fino was after the term start for Vilson Ahmeti" is true based on the information provided in the table.
90	The statement "Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were all members of the Socialist Party of Albania political party" is supported by the information in the table. All four of these individuals served as prime ministers of Albania, and in the "political party" column for their respective terms, it is listed as "Socialist Party of Albania." Therefore, it can be concluded that they were indeed members of that political party.
91	The statement "the term end for Vilson Ahmeti was after the term end for Ylli Bufi" is supported by the table. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term ended on December 10, 1991, and Vilson Ahmeti's term started on the same day. Vilson Ahmeti's term ended on April 13, 1992, which is after Ylli Bufi's term end. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information provided in the table.
92	The table provided does not contain information about the first person to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania Political Party. However, it does include information about Sal Berisha who served as a Prime Minister of Albania from September 2005 to September 2013, and he was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. Therefore, the statement "Sali Berisha was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania Political Party" is supported by the table. However, the statement "He was the first person since Aleksandër Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania Political Party" cannot be verified from the table, as it does not specify each politician's first election.
93	The statement "only one person has been a member of the party of labour of Albania political party and been elected" is supported by the table. The table shows Fatos Nano as the only prime minister who was a member of the Party of Labour of Albania (row 3) and who was elected (row 1). Therefore, the statement appears to be true based on the information provided in the table.
94	The statement is supported by the table. We can see from the table that the term start for Ylli Bufi was June 5th, 1991, while the term start for Vilson Ahmeti was December 10th, 1991. Therefore, Ylli Bufi's term start was indeed before Vilson Ahmeti's term start.
95	The statement is refuted by the table. Specifically:- Ilir Meta served as Prime Minister of Albania from 1999 to 2002 and is listed as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.- Bashkim Fino served as Prime Minister of Albania from 1997 to 1998 and is listed as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.- Ylli Bufi served as Prime Minister of Albania from 1991 to 1992 and is listed as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.- Pandeli Majko (1st time) served as Prime Minister of Albania from 1998 to 1999 and is listed as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.Therefore, none of these four prime ministers were members of the Democratic Party of Albania.
96	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Ylli Bufi served as the Prime Minister of Albania from June 5, 1991, to December 10, 1991. Aleksandër Meksi, on the other hand, served as Prime Minister from April 13, 1992, to March 11, 1997. Therefore, the term end for Aleksandër Meksi was after the term end for Ylli Bufi.
97	The table shows that Ilir Meta was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania during his term as Prime Minister from October 1999 to February 2002. Therefore, this statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
98	I'm sorry, but the statement "only one person has been a member of the socialist party of Albania" is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that multiple individuals have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania, including Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano (2nd time), Pandeli Majko (1st time), Ilir Meta, Pandeli Majko (2nd time), and Edi Rama. All of these individuals served as Prime Ministers of Albania and belonged to the Socialist Party of Albania during their term(s). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
99	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows two players with the last name Dawkins: Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins. However, their years with the team did not overlap. Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1987-88, while Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1979-80. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Jazz had two players with the last name Dawkins, but their time with the team did not overlap.
100	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz for only one year (1979-80), while Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1987-88. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
101	The statement is refuted by the table. Adrian Dantley was on the team from 1979 to 1986, while Brad Davis was only on the team in 1979-80. Therefore, they were not on the team for the entire time.
102	The statement "James Donaldson had two stints on the Jazz's roster" is supported by the information in the table. James Donaldson, a center from Washington State, appears in row 7 of the table and is listed as having played for the Jazz in 1993 as well as in 1994-1995, which indicates that he had two separate stints on the Jazz's roster.
103	Refuted. The table shows that the Utah Jazz had only two guards on their roster during the 1979 - 80 season: Brad Davis and Paul Dawkins. Therefore, the statement that the Jazz had at least three guards that were on the team 1979-80 is refuted by the table.
104	The statement is refuted by the table. There is only one player with the last name Dawkins in the table, and he is listed as Darryl Dawkins, playing as a center from 1987-88. The table does not show any other players with the last name Dawkins, so it is not possible to confirm if any other Dawkins players were on the team, let alone if their time on the team overlapped or not. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
105	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. The table shows that Darryl Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz for one year, in 1987-88, while Paul Dawkins played with the Jazz for one year, in 1979-80. Therefore, Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz before Darryl Dawkins, so the statement is false.
106	The statement is partially supported by the table. Adrian Dantley was on the team for a total of seven years from 1979 to 1986, which overlaps with Brad Davis's one-year tenure in 1979-80. However, the statement is incorrect in terms of the number of years by which Dantley surpassed Davis. Dantley only played one extra year with the Jazz after Davis left, meaning Dantley played a total of seven years, while Davis played only one year. So, Adrian Dantley was on the team the same time as Brad Davis, but Dantley only surpassed Davis by one additional year, not four.
107	The statement is partially supported by the information in the table. According to the table, James Donaldson played for the Utah Jazz in 1993 and then again in 1994-95, which makes it two stints on the Jazz's roster. However, Donaldson's total years with the team add up to only three years, not five as the statement claims. Therefore, the statement is refuted in part by the given table.
108	Refuted. According to the table, the Jazz had only two guards during the 1979-80 season: Brad Davis and Paul Dawkins. James Donaldson is listed as a center and did not play for the Jazz until 1993. Therefore, the statement that "the jazz had at least three guards that were on the team during 1979 - 80, one being James Donaldson" is refuted.
109	I'm sorry, but the statement "the open championship is the tournament with the highest number of events" is not supported by the table provided. The table lists the number of events played by Brian Watts in each of the four tournaments, which are: Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. According to the table, Brian Watts played in 2 events at the Masters Tournament, 2 events at the US Open, 7 events at The Open Championship, and 6 events at the PGA Championship.Therefore, the tournament with the highest number of events in this table is The Open Championship with 7 events, which does not support the statement that The Open Championship is the tournament with the highest number of events.
110	The statement "none of the tournaments resulted in a win for Brian Watts" is supported by the table. As we can see from the table, the "wins" column for all four tournaments (Masters, US Open, Open Championship, PGA Championship) and the "totals" row are 0. This means that Brian Watts did not win any of these tournaments.
111	Based on the table given, the statement "the pga championship had three more cuts made than the us open" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the US Open had one cut made out of two events, while the PGA Championship had four cuts made out of six events. Therefore, the difference between the cuts made for these two tournaments is three (4-1 = 3), which supports the statement that the PGA Championship had three more cuts made than the US Open.
112	I'm sorry, but the statement "all the tournaments listed had an average of 2.5 events" cannot be supported or refuted by the information provided in the table. The table contains information about the number of wins, top-5 finishes, top-25 finishes, events played, and cuts made by Brian watts in four specific golf tournaments: the Masters Tournament, the US Open, the Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. The table does not provide information about the number of events played on average in these tournaments or any other tournaments. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table as there is no relevant information in the table.
113	The statement "Brian Watts did not make the top - 25 at the Masters Tournament" is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts did not record a top-25 finish in the Masters Tournament as he has 0 top-25 finishes, and his best finish was a cut made out of two events. Therefore, the statement is accurate and supported by the information presented in the table.
114	The statement "for Brian Watts, the Open Championship is the tournament with his second-highest number of events" is supported by the table. Looking at the "Events" column, the Open Championship (also known as the British Open) is listed as having seven events overall, which is the second-highest number of events for Brian Watts. The only tournament where he competed in more events is the PGA Championship with six total events. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
115	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Brian Watts won exactly one major tournament" is refuted. The table shows that Brian Watts did not win any major tournaments, as indicated by the "wins" column where it is listed as 0 in all major tournaments. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is not supported by the table.
116	I apologize, but the information provided in the table does not allow for the comparison between the number of cuts made by Brian Watts in the PGA Championship and the US Open.The table shows that Brian Watts has played in 2 US Open events and made 1 cut while he has played in 6 PGA Championship events and made 4 cuts. However, the table does not provide information on the number of cuts he made in each individual event or the comparison between the two events.Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information given in the table.
117	The statement seems to be supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts did not have a top-25 finish at the masters tournament. In fact, he did not even make the cut in one of the two Masters tournaments he played. Therefore, the statement "Brian watts not the top 25 at the masters tournament one time" is supported by the information in the table.
118	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "9 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus" is supported. The nine viral families in the table that have a replication site in the nucleus are:1. Adenoviridae2. Herpesviridae3. Papillomaviridae4. Polyomaviridae5. Hepadnaviridae6. Retroviridae7. Orthomyxoviridae8. Arenaviridae9. ReoviridaeTherefore, there are nine viral families that replicate within the nucleus according to the table provided.
119	The statement "14 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm" is supported by the information presented in the table. Rows 9-15 (inclusive) specify that the following viral families have a cytoplasmic replication site: Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae. Therefore, there are indeed 14 viral families in the table that have a cytoplasmic replication site.
120	The statement "two viral families have a complex virion shape" is supported by the table. According to the table, both the Herpesviridae (in row 3) and the Poxviridae (in row 6) have a "complex" virion shape, which means they are composed of multiple structural components. Therefore, the statement that "two viral families have a complex virion shape" is supported by the information in this table.
121	The statement "thirteen viral families have an icosahedral virion shape" is supported by the information in the table. Row 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, and 24 have an icosahedral shape listed as their virion shape. Therefore, there are thirteen viral families that have an icosahedral virion shape per the given table.
122	The statement "seven viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table. According to the table, six viral families from Group V (Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae) have an enveloped, helical virion shape. Additionally, the unassigned family has a spherical, enveloped virion shape that may also have a helical component to it. Therefore, there are seven viral families with a helical virion shape in the table.
123	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "nine of the viral diseases replicate in the nucleus" is supported. There are a total of 9 viral families that replicate in the nucleus according to the table:- Adenoviridae- Herpesviridae- Papillomaviridae- Polyomaviridae- Hepadnaviridae- Retroviridae- Orthomyxoviridae- Arenaviridae- ReoviridaeTherefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
124	Based on the information present in the table, the statement "only one of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape" is refuted. In row 23, it is mentioned that the virus in the "unassigned" family has a spherical virion shape. Therefore, there is more than one viral disease that has a spherical virion shape, refuting the given statement.
125	The statement "eight of the viral diseases are non-enveloped" is supported by the table. In rows 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9-11, the corresponding viral families are all listed as "non-enveloped". This adds up to a total of eight viral families which are non-enveloped.
126	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "only one of the viral diseases is in Baltimore group III" is refuted. There are at least two viral diseases listed in the table that belong to Baltimore group III, which are reoviridae and rotaviridae.
127	The statement "only one of the viral diseases has not been assigned to a family" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 23 of the table states "unassigned" under the "family" column, which means that there is a viral disease that has not been assigned to a family. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information provided in the table.
128	The statement "9 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm" is supported by the information provided in the table. Based on the information in the table, the families that have a cytoplasmic replication site are Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae, totaling 9 viral families.
129	Based on the information in the table, the statement "14 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus" is not supported. There are only four viral families listed in the table that have a replication site in the nucleus: Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, and Polyomaviridae. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
130	The statement "two viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table. There are five viral families in the table that have a helical virion shape, and they are:1. Coronaviridae2. Orthomyxoviridae3. Arenaviridae4. Bunyaviridae5. FiloviridaeTherefore, the statement is supported as there are more than one viral family with a helical virion shape.
131	Refuted. The table shows that only five viral families have an enveloped virion shape that is helical (Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae), which is less than half of the thirteen families mentioned in the statement. The other families have either a non-enveloped icosahedral or complex shape, or an enveloped shape that is spherical or icosahedral. Therefore, the statement "thirteen viral families have a helical virion shape"g is not supported by the table.
132	The statement "seven viral families have an icosahedral virion shape" is supported by the information in the table. Rows 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 through 11 describe non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral shape, and rows 7, 13, and 14 describe enveloped viruses with an icosahedral shape, making for a total of seven virus families with this shape.
133	According to the information presented in the table, this statement is supported. Nine viral families listed in the table are known to replicate outside of the nucleus:- Poxviridae- Astroviridae- Caliciviridae- Picornaviridae- Coronaviridae- Flaviviridae- Togaviridae- Hepeviridae- ReoviridaeThese viral families are indicated in the table as replicating in the cytoplasm.
134	The statement, "none of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The virion shape for the unassigned group in row 23 is described as spherical.
135	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. There are eight viral families in the table that possess an envelope: Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Retroviridae.
136	Unfortunately, I cannot provide a conclusive answer to whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table as the table only provides the Baltimore group classification for different viral families and does not specify which viral diseases belong to each group. Additionally, each viral family can cause multiple viral diseases, and the table does not provide information on specific viral diseases. Therefore, more context is needed to determine whether the statement is true or false. If you have any specific viral diseases in mind and know their corresponding virus family, I can help you check if they belong to Baltimore group III.
137	I'm sorry, but I cannot accurately support or refute the statement using the table provided. The table details the families of various viral diseases, so it doesn't provide information on the number of viral diseases assigned to each family. Additionally, the statement is too vague to identify which family or viral disease it is referring to specifically. Can you please provide me with additional details, or perhaps rephrase the statement?
138	I'm sorry, but I cannot support nor refute the statement that "Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court" with the given table. The table provided only shows the outcomes, dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores of several matches played by Galina Voskoboeva, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of games she played on a hard tennis court. The table includes matches on hard courts, clay courts, and indoor hard courts, but there is no total number of games played on any specific surface mentioned.
139	Unfortunately, the given table does not provide enough information to determine the percentage of Galina Voskoboeva's games played on a clay surface. The table only lists the dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores of a few specific matches. It is possible that Galina Voskoboeva played on clay courts in some of her other matches, but this cannot be determined from the limited information in the table. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
140	I apologize, but I cannot accurately answer that question based on the table provided. The table shows only the outcomes, dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores for a selected few matches in which Galina Voskoboeva participated. It does not provide information on all the matches she has played on both clay and hard courts to determine a win rate. Thus, there's no way to support or refute the statement based solely on this table.
141	After reviewing the table, I can see that the statement "Galina Voskoboeva never played the same opponent more than one time" is refuted. In the table, Galina Voskoboeva played against Matea Mezak, Lilia Osterloh, and Roberta Vinci more than one time. Specifically, she played against Mezak in the Tipton tournament on January 28, 2003, and against her again on May 24, 2004, at the Galatina tournament. She faced Osterloh first in the Lexington tournament on July 25, 2005, and then again on November 8, 2005, in the Pittsburgh event. Finally, she faced Vinci twice, first in the Latina tournament on October 3, 2003, and second at the Szeged tournament on July 8, 2013.
142	Unfortunately, the table provided does not provide information on the average points lost by Galina Voskoboeva in her matches. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the statement "on average, Galina Voskoboeva loses with only four points" is supported or refuted by the table.
143	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the table. The table only provides information on specific tournaments and matches Galina Voskoboeva played, and it does not offer a comprehensive list of all the tournaments and surfaces she played on throughout her career. Therefore, we cannot confirm the number of games she played on each surface.
144	I'm sorry, but I cannot confirm or refute the given statement based on the table provided. The table only includes information related to five of Galina Voskoboeva's tennis matches, including the outcome, dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores. There is no mention of the percentage of matches played on clay or hard surfaces by Voskoboeva. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the provided table.
145	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is refuted. While Galina Voskoboeva has indeed played on both clay and hard courts, she did win on at least one occasion. The table shows that she won the tournament in Mont-de-Marsan on hard court in June 2003 with a score of 6-4, 6-2. However, it's worth noting that she did not win on clay - she was a runner-up in Latina in October 2003 and lost to Roberta Vinci with a score of 3-6, 4-6. Therefore, while she has not won on clay, the statement claiming that she has an equal winrate between both clay and hard courts is false.
146	According to the table provided, this statement is refuted. The table shows that Galina Voskoboeva played Matea Mezak on 28th January 2003, and Lilia Osterloh on 8th November 2005, which contradicts the statement. Therefore, Galina Voskoboeva played against two different opponents more than once (each opponent once more), not just on 6 June 2006 as mentioned in the statement.
147	I apologize, but the table doesn't provide enough information to support or refute the given statement about Galina Voskoboeva. The table only shows the outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score of five matches played by Galina Voskoboeva. It doesn't mention the number of points lost or won by her against any particular opponent. Therefore, I cannot draw any conclusions about Galina Voskoboeva's average points lost against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa based on the table.
148	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 stages out of the 25 total stages in the 1933 Giro d'Italia, from the second stage (Turin to Genoa) until the end of the race in Milan.
149	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Alfredo Binda won six stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia - on May 7th (Turin to Genoa), May 14th (Rome to Naples), May 17th (Foggia to Chieti), May 18th (Chieti to Ascoli Piceno), May 22nd (Bologna to Ferrara), and May 28th (Bolzano to Milan). Additionally, the table shows that Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 of the 25 stages (race leader column) throughout the Giro d'Italia.
150	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that on May 26th, Gerard Loncke from Belgium won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano. It also shows that Alfredo Binda from Italy was the race leader at that point, as indicated in the "race leader" column. Therefore, the statement that Gerard Loncke won the 1933 Giro d'Italia on May 26th, despite Alfredo Binda being the race leader, is supported by the information presented in the table.
151	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ettore Meini won the 18th and 19th stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, which were held on May 24th and May 25th, respectively. Therefore, Meini won two races in a row during the 1933 Giro d'Italia, as stated in the statement.
152	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Learco Guerra was the race leader after the first stage between Milan and Turin, and also won the third stage from Genoa to Pisa, becoming the race leader again. However, Alfredo Binda took over the race leader position after the fourth stage from Genoa to Pisa and became the overall winner of the 1933 Giro d'Italia. Therefore, the statement is inaccurate as it falsely claims that Learco Guerra did not become the race leader again for the rest of the circuit.
153	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia. His name appears in the "race leader" column for all 15 stages, from Turin to Genoa (Stage 2) to Bolzano to Milan (Stage 24).
154	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that Alfredo Binda won seven races during the 1933 Giro d'Italia, and that he was the race leader for 15 days.
155	The statement is supported by the table for May 25th, where it shows that Gerard Loncke (Belgium) was the winner of the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano. However, the table shows that Alfredo Binda (Italy) was still the race leader on that day. Therefore, the statement is partially true because Gerard Loncke won the stage but Alfredo Binda was still the overall race leader on May 25th of 1933 Giro d'Italia.
156	According to the table you provided, Ettore Meini won the 18th stage of the 1933 Giro d'Italia on May 24th, and he also won the 19th stage on May 25th. However, the table does not show any race on May 26th, so the statement that Ettore Meini won three races in a row on those three days is refuted by the table.
157	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Learco Guerra won the first race of the 1933 Giro d'Italia and became the race leader. However, Alfredo Binda took over as the race leader after the second race and held onto that position for the rest of the circuit. Guerra did win another stage during the Giro, but he never regained the race leader position. Therefore, the statement that Guerra became the race leader again for the rest of the circuit is refuted by the table.
158	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. As per the table, two players, Ray Donaldson and Tim Foley, were picked during the 2nd round of the Indianapolis Colts draft history (rows 4 and 5, respectively) with the overall picks of 32 and 51, respectively.
159	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Wes Roberts was selected in the 7th round, with the 5th pick, and Ed Whitley was selected in the 11th round, with the 3rd pick. This indicates that Wes Roberts was indeed picked by the Indianapolis Colts before Ed Whitley was chosen.
160	Supported. According to the table, there are two players drafted from USC (University of Southern California) - Ray Butler (wide receiver) and Chris Foote (center). At the same time, there is only one player drafted from Clemson University - Marvin Sims (fullback). Therefore, the statement "more players were drafted from usc than from clemson" is supported by the information in the table.
161	Based on the information provided in the table, I cannot confirm nor refute the statement "no players in the running back position were picked after the 10th round". The table only includes data up to the 12th round of the draft, and while it does include one running back in the 1st round (Curtis Dickey), it does not include any additional running backs selected in rounds 2-12. However, it's possible that the Colts have drafted running backs in later rounds in drafts not represented by this table.
162	Yes, the statement "Curtis Dickey was picked during an earlier round than Randy Bielski" is supported by the table. Curtis Dickey was picked in the first round, fifth overall, while Randy Bielski was picked in the twelfth round, 311th overall.
163	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that five players were selected in the 2nd round of the draft. They are:- Ray Donaldson, center, Georgia- Tim Foley, offensive tackle, Notre Dame- Ray Butler, wide receiver, USC- Chris Foote, center, USC- Wes Roberts, defensive end, TCUTherefore, the statement that "5 players were picked in the 2nd rounds of the draft" is accurate based on the information in the table.
164	The statement is refuted by the table because we can see that Wes Roberts was picked in the 7th round, 5th pick (7|5|170), and Ed Whitley was picked in the 11th round, 3rd pick (11|3|280). Therefore, both players were picked in different rounds, and not the 3rd round as stated in the statement.
165	The statement "USC and Clemson College had the most players drafted at 3 each" is refuted by the table provided as there is only one player from USC (Ray Butler) and one player from Clemson (Marvin Sims) in the table. Therefore, the table does not support the statement about USC and Clemson College having the most players drafted at 3 each.
166	Refuted. According to the table, only two running backs were selected in the Indianapolis Colts draft history: Curtis Dickey in the 1st round and Mark Bright in the 9th round. Therefore, the statement that "there was 3 running back positions picked by the 6th round" is not supported by the information provided in the table.
167	The statement "Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski were picked in round 2" is not supported by the information in the table. Curtis Dickey was chosen with the Colts' 5th overall pick in the first round of the 1980 draft, and Randy Bielski was chosen with their 12th round pick in the 1982 draft. Therefore, neither of these players were picked in round 2, which contradicts the statement.
168	The statement "Italy received two more gold medals than Canada did but tied with the United States and West Germany" is supported by the table. As per the table:- Italy won 2 gold medals (Row 10).- Canada did not win any gold medals (Row 12).- United States won 2 gold medals (Row 9).- West Germany won 2 gold medals (Row 8).Therefore, Italy did receive two more gold medals than Canada, and tied with both United States and West Germany in terms of gold medals won.
169	The statement that "Sweden placed higher than Austria in the total medal count for the 1988 Olympics" is supported by the information presented in the table. Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, and 2 bronze) and ranked 5th in the total medal count. On the other hand, Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze) and ranked 6th in the total medal count.Therefore, Sweden placed higher than Austria in the total medal count for the 1988 Olympics.
170	The statement that "six different countries received the same number of bronze medals" is supported by the table. The total number of bronze medals awarded to Switzerland, Finland, Austria, Netherlands, West Germany, and Canada is all the same at 2.
171	The statement you provided is refuted by the information in the table. The table shows that Italy, Switzerland, and Netherlands also received medals in all three categories (gold, silver, and bronze), and therefore, the statement that only Sweden and Canada did not receive a medal in one of the categories is false. Additionally, Sweden received medals in all three categories (gold, silver, and bronze), while Canada received medals in two categories (silver and bronze), so they both received medals in the Winter Olympics of 1988.
172	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Soviet Union won a total of 29 medals at the 1988 Winter Olympics (11 gold, 9 silver, 9 bronze), while East Germany won a total of 25 medals (9 gold, 10 silver, 6 bronze). Therefore, the Soviet Union won four more medals than East Germany in the total medal count.
173	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Italy won 2 gold medals, 1 less than both the United States and West Germany. Also, Italy did not receive any gold medals in excess of Canada; Canada received more total medals than Italy, but both won the same number of gold medals (2). Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
174	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, and 2 bronze) and Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze) at the 1988 Winter Olympics. Therefore, Sweden didn't place lower than Austria in the total medal count, as Sweden won fewer medals than Austria.
175	Sorry, but the statement "eight different countries received the same number of bronze medals" is refuted by the information in the table. As shown in the table, there were only five countries who received bronze medals. Switzerland, Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Canada each received a different number of bronze medals. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
176	That statement is supported by the information in the table. Sweden did not receive any silver medals, and Canada did not receive any gold medals, as shown in the table, indicating that they did not receive medals in two of the categories.
177	The statement is supported by the table.According to the table, the Soviet Union won a total of 29 medals (11 gold, 9 silver, and 9 bronze) and East Germany won a total of 25 medals (9 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze). The total medal count for the Soviet Union is six more than the total medal count for East Germany, which confirms that the statement is supported by the table.
178	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Based on the "apparent magnitude" column in the table, we can see that ngc 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9, followed by ngc 1705 with 12.8. Therefore, the statement "ngc 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 followed by ngc 1705 with 12.8" is true based on the information provided in the table.
179	The statement "ngc 1705 has the smallest redshift at 633 kilometers per second plus or minus 6 kilometers per second" is supported by the information in the table. In row 18, under the "redshift (km / s)" column, we see the value "633 ± 6" listed for NGC 1705, which is indeed the smallest redshift value listed in the table.
180	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the redshift for NGC 2082 is 1184 km/s while the redshift for NGC 1705 is 633 km/s. Therefore, the redshift of NGC 2082 is faster than that of NGC 1705 by 551 km/s, which supports the statement. However, the table does not provide a plus or minus 6 km/s accuracy level for the redshifts, so the statement cannot be confirmed or refuted in that regard.
181	The statement is supported by the table. Examining the table, we can see that the galaxy NGC 1574 has a declination of degree 58′29″, which is indeed the "deepest" declination among all the galaxies listed in the table. Therefore, the statement that "ngc 1574 has a deeper declination (or dec) of °58′29″, than any other galaxy in the dorado group" is true based on the information in the table.
182	Yes, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. The lowest right ascension (or ra) in the table is indeed ngc 1533 with a right ascension of 4 hours 9 minutes and 51.8 seconds, which is in the eleventh row of the table.
183	The statement is incorrect. From the table, we can see that the largest apparent magnitude is 12.9, but it's not for NGC 1515. The object with the largest apparent magnitude is NGC 1796, which has an apparent magnitude of 12.9.Moreover, the next highest apparent magnitude is not for NGC 1705, but for NGC 2082, which has an apparent magnitude of 12.6.Therefore, the statement that "NGC 1515 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 followed by NGC 1705 with 12.8" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
184	I apologize for my previous message. I made a mistake in the row number. Here's the correct answer:The statement "ngc 1705 has the largest redshift at 633 kilometers per second plus or minus 6 kilometers per second" is supported by the information presented in the table. From row 18, we can see that ngc 1705 has a redshift of 633 ± 6 km/s, which is the highest redshift value presented in the table.
185	The statement is supported by the table. - The redshift of NGC 2082 is 1184 ± 6 km/s, while the redshift of NGC 1705 is 633 ± 6 km/s. - Therefore, the redshift of NGC 1705 is faster by 551 km/s, which is greater than the stated difference of 441 km/s.- However, since the redshift measurement has a certain amount of uncertainty, it is possible that the actual difference in redshift between NGC 1705 and NGC 2082 falls within the stated range of 441 ± 6 km/s.
186	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be verified using the provided table. The table includes information about the dorado group's galaxies such as their names, types, right ascension, declination, redshifts, and apparent magnitudes. However, it does not provide any information on the declination of each galaxy relative to the others in the group.
187	The statement you provided is inconsistent with the information presented in the table. The lowest "right ascension" or "ra" in the table is actually "ic 2056" with an "ra" of "04h16m24.5s", which is greater than "4 hours 8 minutes and 58.1 seconds". Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
188	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "September 4, 2007" is the earliest date recorded, and the corresponding site is "Cedar Rapids", where the sport played was "m golf" and the winning team was "Iowa State", with the series score being "2-0". Therefore, Cedar Rapids is indeed the site with the earliest date in the table.
189	The statement is supported by the table. The earliest sport listed in the table is men's golf on September 4, 2007, and the second earliest sport listed in the table is volleyball on September 8, 2007. Therefore, volleyball is indeed the sport with the 2nd earliest date listed in the table.
190	Yes, the statement "softball is the sport with the latest date" is supported by the table. As we can see, the last row of the table is for the softball game played on April 1st, 2008, which is the latest date in the table.
191	The statement "w gymnastics is the sport with the earliest date in 2008" is supported by the information in the table. The earliest date in 2008 in the table is February 22, 2008, which corresponds to Row 12 that features a victory for Iowa State in W Gymnastics against an unnamed opponent. Therefore, the statement is correct based on the given table.
192	The statement is supported by the table. The latest date in 2007 mentioned in the table is December 9, 2007, and the corresponding sport is wrestling. Therefore, the statement "wrestling is the sport with the latest date in 2007" is supported by the provided table.
193	Yes, the statement "Ames is the site with the earliest date" is supported by the information in the table. The earliest date listed in the table is September 4th, 2007, and the event was held in Cedar Rapids. However, the second event listed in the table was also held in Ames on September 15th, 2007, which is still earlier than any other events listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is true, as Ames is the site with the earliest date in the iowa corn cy - hawk series.
194	The statement "volleyball is the sport with the earliest date" is supported by the table. The first row of the table shows that the first event in the series was a men's golf match on September 4, 2007. However, the second row of the table shows that the first event with volleyball, took place four days later, on September 8, 2007, which is earlier than all other events listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "volleyball is the sport with the earliest date" is supported by the table.
195	Yes, that statement is supported by the table. The softball match occurred on April 1, 2008, which is the latest date listed in the table except for the last row, which does not have a specific date. Therefore, softball is the sport with the second-latest date in the table, after the final row which does not have an associated date.
196	The statement is supported by the table. As per the given table, the earliest date for a sport in 2007 was February 22, 2008, which was when the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series had their first women's gymnastics meet that year. Therefore, the statement is accurate as it aligns with the information in the table.
197	Yes, the statement "wrestling is the sport with the latest date in 2008" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the wrestling match between Iowa and Iowa State took place on December 9, 2007, which is the latest date for any match or game in the table. The matches and games listed after that date are all in 2008, but none of them took place later than December 9, 2007. Therefore, the statement is true based on the given information.
198	The statement "the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography did not go to William Ivey Long" is supported by the table. As per the table, the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography was won by Jerry Mitchell for la cage aux folles (musical), while William Ivey Long was nominated for Outstanding Costume Design, but did not win in the Outstanding Choreography category.
199	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 5 of the table, William Ivey Long was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Costume Design in 2005 for la cage aux folles (musical). So, the statement "nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony awards was William Ivey Long" is supported by the information in the table.
200	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Jerry Mitchell is one of two winners of a Tony Award" is supported. Jerry Mitchell won the Tony Award for Best Choreography in 2005 for his work on "La Cage aux Folles," as indicated in row 4 of the table. Therefore, the statement is true.
201	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Jerry Mitchell is one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award" is partially supported. While Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award in 2005 in the category of "Outstanding Choreography" for "La Cage aux Folles," the table does not provide information about how many nominees were in this category. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny whether Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees in this category.
202	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 3 of the table, Gary Beach was nominated for the 2005 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical for his role in "La Cage aux Folles."
203	I'm sorry, but the statement is incorrect. The information provided in the table does not support the statement that "William Ivey Long won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography." In fact, the table shows that Jerry Mitchell won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005 for his work on la cage aux folles (musical). William Ivey Long, on the other hand, was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design (but did not win).Therefore, the correct statement that is supported by the table is: "Jerry Mitchell won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography for his work on la cage aux folles (musical)."
204	The statement "the 2005 nominee for best costume design won the award" is refuted by the table provided. According to the table, the nominee for best costume design in 2005 was William Ivey Long, and he was only nominated for the award, not winning. The award for best costume design in 2005 was ultimately won by someone else, whose name is not listed in this table.
205	The statement "jerry mitchell won two tony awards" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, in 2005, Jerry Mitchell won Tony Awards for Best Choreography, and in Drama Desk Awards, he also won Outstanding Choreography. Therefore, the table shows that Jerry Mitchell won two awards for choreography, one of them being a Tony Award.
206	The statement "Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award three times" is not supported by the table. According to the table, Jerry Mitchell won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005 for his work on "La Cage aux Folles," and he was not nominated for any other Drama Desk Awards that year. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
207	The statement "Gary Beach is one of four winners of a Tony Award" is not supported by the information provided in the table. Gary Beach was nominated for a 2005 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical for his role in "La Cage Aux Folles," but he did not win. Jerry Mitchell won the 2005 Tony Award for Best Choreography for his work on "La Cage Aux Folles," and William Ivey Long was nominated for the 2005 Tony Award for Best Costume Design for his work on the musical. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
208	I'm sorry to inform you that the statement "Lleyton Hewitt has won the Master Series finals two times, in 2002 and 2003" is not supported by the table provided. The table only lists the various championships Lleyton Hewitt participated in during the years 2000 to 2005, along with the outcomes for each of those championships. While it does show that he won the Indian Wells championship twice in 2002 and 2003, it doesn't mention Master Series finals. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table.
209	Based on the table provided, I can see that there were eight Master Series finals in which Lleyton Hewitt competed. However, there is no information in the table about how many of those finals had one side or the other finishing with 6 points. Therefore, I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the information in the table.
210	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As per row 5, the tournament was held in Paris, and the surface was carpet. None of the other tournaments listed in the table had a carpet surface.
211	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the table, Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up five times out of a total of seven championships listed in the table. This can be seen in rows 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 where he finished as the runner-up in Stuttgart 2000, Cincinnati 2002, Paris 2002, Cincinnati 2004, and Indian Wells 2005, respectively. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
212	After examining the table, the statement "Lleyton Hewitt never faced the same opponent in more than one Master Series finals" is supported by the information presented. As we can see, in the table, for each year that Lleyton Hewitt made it to a Master Series final, he faced a different opponent. Therefore, there is no evidence in this table that suggests otherwise, and the statement is supported.
213	Based on the table provided, the statement "Lleyton Hewitt has won the Masters Series two times, in 2004 and 2005" is not supported. While the table lists several tournaments where Hewitt either won or was a runner-up, there is no indication that he won the Masters Series in 2004 or 2005. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
214	Based on the given table, the statement "19 of Lleyton Hewitt Masters Series finals had one side or the other finishing with 4 points" cannot be refuted or supported as the table only presents the year, championship, surface, opponent, and score of each match, but not how many points each side finished with. Therefore, no information in the table can be used to support or refute this statement.
215	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the 2002 Paris final was played on a carpet surface.
216	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up once out of a total of seven matches. Specifically, he was a runner-up in the 2000 Stuttgart championship, where he faced Wayne Ferreira in the final, and lost in a five-set match (6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 2-6).
217	The statement is refuted by the table as the table shows that Lleyton Hewitt only faced Wayne Ferreira once in a Masters Series final, which was in 2000 at Stuttgart, and he was the runner-up in that championship against Ferreira. In all the other finals listed in the table, he faced different opponents in each one.
218	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 7 and 8 show that the Kirin Cup had games on both May 17 and May 21, 1998. The score and venue information are also listed for each of these games. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is supported by the data presented in the table.
219	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that there were four games played in the World Cup during June 1998, and all of them were played in France, as indicated by the venue in rows 12 to 15.
220	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that on June 1, 1998, there was a game between Paraguay and Netherlands at Philips Stadion Eindhoven, Netherlands, which ended with a score of 5-1 (comp: f, report: 457). On June 3, 1998, there was a game between Romania and Paraguay at Steaua Stadium Bucharest, Romania, which ended with a score of 3-2 (comp: f, report: 458). Therefore, Netherlands and Romania had games on June 1 and June 3, respectively, in 1998, which is supported by the information in the table.
221	The statement "neither team scored for the first two games of the world cup in France" is supported by the information in the table. Rows 12 and 13 of the table show the dates and venues for the first two games of the world cup in France, and the scores are reported as 0-0 for both games. Therefore, neither team scored in the first two games of the world cup in France, which supports the statement.
222	I'm sorry, the table you provided does not support the statement "the games on June 18 and 28, 1998, both had a score of 1-1."According to the table, on June 18, 1998, Paraguay played against Bulgaria in the World Cup and the game ended with a score of 0-0. Similarly, on June 28, 1998, Paraguay played against Germany in the World Cup and the game ended with a score of 0-0 (1-0 AET).Therefore, the statement "the games on June 18 and 28, 1998, both had a score of 1-1" is refuted by the table.
223	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 8 and row 9 in the table, the Kirin Cup had games on both June 1 and June 3, 1998. The first game was played on May 17, 1998, and the last game was played on June 28, 1998. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information provided in the table.
224	Sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the table you gave me. The table only shows matches played by the Paraguayan national team in 1998, including their participation in the World Cup held in France. Although the World Cup matches are included, they were not held in Japan, but rather in France, as indicated by the venue information in the table: Stade de la Mosson Montpellier, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Saint-Étienne, Stade de Toulouse Toulouse, and Stade Félix Bollaert Lens. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
225	The table does not provide information about games played by the Netherlands and Romania on June 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
226	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is refuted. There were three games in the World Cup in France in which neither team scored. These games were:- 1998-06-12: Paraguay vs Bulgaria (0-0)- 1998-06-19: Paraguay vs Spain (0-0)- 1998-06-28: Paraguay vs France (0-0 (1-0 aet))Therefore, the statement that neither team scored only in the first game of the World Cup in France is incorrect.
227	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. There were no games played on June 18 or 28 listed in the table, and none of the scores listed match the score of 2-0. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table.
228	The statement is supported by the table. The Solheim Cup was hosted in the US on 7 occasions from 1990 through 2013.
229	The statement "the United States team won 8 of the Solheim Cups starting in 1990 and the last was in 2009" is supported by the information provided in the table. As per the table, the United States team won the Solheim Cups in the years 1990, 1994, 1996, 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2009, which is a total of 8 wins. The last win for the United States team was indeed in 2009, at the Rich Harvest Farms in Illinois, as mentioned in the table.
230	The statement "Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth were all captains that won the cup two times" is supported by the information in the table. Patty Sheehan won as captain in 2002 and 2003 with the United States and Europe respectively. Judy Rankin won as captain in 1996 and 1998 with the United States. Kathy Whitworth won as captain in 1990 and 1992 with the United States and Europe respectively.
231	The statement is supported by the table. The Solheim Cup was hosted outside of the United States six times from 1990 - 2013, as follows: - 1992: Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland- 1996: St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales- 2003: Barsebäck Golf & Country Club, Sweden- 2005: Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA- 2007: Halmstad GK, Sweden- 2011: Killeen Castle Golf Resort, IrelandTherefore, the Solheim Cup was hosted outside of the United States six times during the time period mentioned in the statement.
232	The statement is supported by the table. The highest score for a winning team was indeed 18 in the Solheim Cup, achieved by Europe in 2013 when they defeated the USA. The lowest score for a winning team was also 11.5, achieved twice by Europe in 1992 and 2000. Therefore, the statement is true and supported by the given table.
233	The supported statement is "the solheim cup was hosted outside the US on seven occasions from 1990-2013." As we can see in the table, the Solheim Cup was hosted outside of the US on seven occasions between 1990 and 2013. These occasions are:- 1992 at Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland- 1996 at St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales- 1998 at Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA (hosted by the US but held outside the US)- 2002 at Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA (hosted by the US but held outside the US)- 2003 at Barsebäck Golf & Country Club, Sweden- 2007 at Halmstad GK, Sweden- 2011 at Killeen Castle Golf Resort, IrelandTherefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
234	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the US won the Solheim Cup in 2009, and they have won a total of seven titles since 1990.
235	The statement "Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth were all captains that won the Solheim Cup one time" is supported by the information in the table. Patty Sheehan won the Solheim Cup as the US captain in 2002, while Judy Rankin won as the US captain in 1998 and 1996. Finally, Kathy Whitworth won as the US captain in 1990. Therefore, all three captains won the Solheim Cup one time each.
236	The statement "the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States six times from 1990-2013" is supported by the information in the table. From the table, we can see that the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States in the years 1990, 1994, 1998, 2005, 2009, and 2013. This is a total of six times, which matches the statement given. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
237	The statement that "the highest score for a winning team was 18, while the lowest score for a winning team was 13" is supported by the information presented in the table. The winning team's scores ranged from 11.5 to 18, with Europe scoring the highest at 18 in 2013 and the United States scoring the lowest at 13 in 1994.
238	The statement is supported by the table. According to rows 29 and 30, on August 30, the Colorado Rockies played against the Athletics, and Mohler (with a record of 1-10) took the loss with a score of 4-3. On August 31, they played against the Athletics again, and Oquist (with a record of 2-5) suffered the loss with a score of 10-4.
239	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the attendance on August 4th against the Philadelphia Phillies was 15,230, and on August 5th against the same team was 16,428. These are the two instances in which the attendance was less than 20,000. For all the other games listed in the table, the attendance was higher than 20,000.
240	The statement is supported by the table. According to rows 25 and 26 of the table, the attendance on August 26 and August 27 was 48063 and 48032, respectively. Therefore, the statement is accurate and is supported by the data provided in the table.
241	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 30 of the table, the Colorado Rockies beat the Athletics with a score of 10-4, and their record went to 68-70. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
242	The statement is supported by the table. On August 27, the Colorado Rockies played against the Cincinnati Reds and won 7-5. The pitcher for the Reds, Scott Remlinger (6-6), took the loss in that game. The win on that day brought the Rockies' record to 64-70, as reported in the table.
243	I'm sorry, but that statement is actually refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the game played on August 30 was between the Rockies and the Athletics, and the final score was 4-3 in favor of the Rockies. However, the winning pitcher for the Rockies was listed as "Mohler (1-10)," not "Mogler" as stated in the statement. Additionally, there is no game listed in the table where the Rockies faced a pitcher named "oquist." Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
244	The statement that "the attendance was less than 20000 over five times between August 4th and 6th" is not supported by the table. As per the table, the attendance for August 4th was 15,230, which is less than 20,000, but there is no other attendance figure listed that is less than 20,000 between August 4th and 6th. August 5th had an attendance of 16,428, August 6th had an attendance of 26,633, and both figures are greater than 20,000. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
245	I'm sorry, but the statement that "on August 26th the attendance was 24343 and on August 27th the attendance was 2142" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the attendance on August 26th was 48,063, and the attendance on August 27th was 48,032. These numbers are significantly higher than the attendance figures mentioned in the statement, and they are inconsistent with the numbers listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
246	I apologize, but the provided table does not have any information regarding any game with the Athletics team. The table only shows games against Pirates, Phillies, Mets, Reds, Astros, Mariners, and Athletics. Therefore, I cannot check the statement against the table as there is no information regarding any game between the Athletics and the Colorado Rockies in the table.
247	I apologize, but the table you provided does not have information on who took the win on August 25th against the Rockies. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
248	The statement "there are two games that took place in the month of december" is supported by the table. According to the table, the Buffalo Bills played two games in the month of December - one on December 5, 1976, against the Miami Dolphins, and another game on December 12, 1976, against the Baltimore Colts.
249	The statement you provided is supported by the table. According to the table, the game that took place on September 13, 1976, against the Miami Dolphins had an attendance of 77,683, which is the highest attendance among all the games mentioned in the table. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
250	Based on the data provided in the table for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season, the statement "the smallest attendance was not at the game against the New England Patriots" is supported. The smallest attendance was recorded during the game against the San Diego Chargers (36539), not during any of the games against the New England Patriots.
251	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the attendance in week 12 was higher than the attendance in week 13" is refuted. In Week 13, when the Buffalo Bills played against the Miami Dolphins, the attendance was 43,475, while in Week 12, when they played against the Detroit Lions, the attendance was 66,875. Therefore, the attendance in Week 12 was higher than the attendance in Week 13, which contradicts the statement made.
252	The statement "the Buffalo Bills lost more games than they won" is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the results column, we see that the Bills lost 11 of their 14 games, and won only 3. Therefore, they lost more games than they won.
253	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. There are two games that took place in November and December, respectively, according to the table:- November 15, 1976: Buffalo Bills vs. Dallas Cowboys- December 12, 1976: Buffalo Bills vs. Baltimore ColtsAll the other games in the table took place in September, October, and the first week of November.
254	I can confirm that the statement is actually refuted by the information presented in the table. While the game that took place on September 13, 1976, against the Miami Dolphins is listed in row 2 of the table, the attendance recorded for that game is 77683, not 44505. Therefore, the statement that the largest attendance of 44505 was at the game that took place on September 13, 1976, is refuted by the attendance figure presented in the table.
255	Based on the table provided, we can see that the attendance for the game against the Baltimore Colts was 71,009, which is not the smallest attendance. The smallest attendance listed in the table was 36,539 for the game against the San Diego Chargers on November 21, 1976. Therefore, the statement "the smallest attendance was not at the game against the New England Patriots but against Baltimore Colts" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
256	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is refuted. The attendance in week 6 was the highest of the three weeks mentioned with a figure of 71,009. The attendance in week 12 was 66,875, and the attendance in week 13 was 43,475. Therefore, the statement "the attendance in week 12 was higher than the attendance in week 6 and 13" is incorrect.
257	To determine if the statement "the Buffalo Bills lost 3 more games than they won" is supported or refuted by the table, we need to count their games won and lost in the table.From the table, we can see that the Buffalo Bills won only 2 games: Week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs.On the other hand, the Buffalo Bills lost 12 games: Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins, Week 2 against the Houston Oilers, Week 5 against the New York Jets, Week 6 against the Baltimore Colts, Week 7 against the New England Patriots, Week 8 against the New York Jets, Week 9 against the New England Patriots, Week 10 against the Dallas Cowboys, Week 11 against the San Diego Chargers, Week 12 against the Detroit Lions, Week 13 against the Miami Dolphins, and Week 14 against the Baltimore Colts.Thus, the Buffalo Bills won only 2 games and lost 12 games during the 1976 season. Therefore, the statement "the Buffalo Bills lost 3 more games than they won" is refuted by the table.
258	The statement is partially supported by the table. While it is true that the Yugoslavian national team won a friendly match against Uruguay by a score of 2:1, they only played one friendly match according to the table, not two as the statement suggests.Therefore, the statement "the Yugoslavian national team won one of its friendlies matches by a score of 2:1" is supported by the information provided in the table.
259	The statement "the yugoslavian national team suffered its worst outcome losing 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27" is supported by the table. In row five of the table, it states that Yugoslavia played against Romania on August 27th in the Balkan Cup and lost with a score of 1:4. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
260	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the yugoslavian national team lost the balkan cup against romania with an aggregate score of 3:4" is refuted. According to the table, Yugoslavia won their match against Romania in the Balkan Cup on March 30, with a score of 2:0. Therefore, they did not lose the Balkan Cup to Romania. Additionally, there is no information presented in the table regarding an aggregate score of 3:4.
261	The statement "the yugoslavian national team failed to score only one time, dropping a world cup qualifying match 0:2 against Italy" is supported by the table. Looking at row 8, we can see that Yugoslavia played a World Cup qualifying match against Italy on November 15, 1980. The results show that Yugoslavia failed to score in that match and lost 0-2 to Italy. This is the only match in the table where Yugoslavia did not score, thus supporting the statement.
262	Based on the table provided, the statement is supported by the information presented. The table shows that Yugoslavia played three 1982 World Cup qualifying matches, and they scored a total of 7 goals while allowing only 1 goal against Luxembourg and 1 goal against Denmark, resulting in a total of 3 goals allowed. Therefore, the statement "the Yugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and allowed 3 against in the three 1982 World Cup qualifying matches" is supported by the table.
263	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is refuted by the table. According to the table, there were two friendly matches played by the Yugoslavian national team, against Uruguay and Poland, and both of them were won by Yugoslavia. However, the score in the match against Uruguay was 2:1, which is different from the score mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
264	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the table of Yugoslavia national football team results you provided earlier. The table shows that on March 22, Yugoslavia played and won against Uruguay, not Poland, in a friendly match in Sarajevo with a score of 2:1. Furthermore, there's no record of Yugoslavia losing against Poland in this table. Therefore, the statement refutes the information presented in the table.
265	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. The table provides the results for seven different games, including a match against Italy, but there is no mention of any match against Romania with a 3:4 aggregate score. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is true or false based on the information in the table.
266	The statement is refuted by the table. The yugoslavian national team actually won the match against Denmark with a score of 2:1, as shown in the table in row 7, which states "September 27, Ljubljana, Denmark, 2:1, 1982 WCQ". Therefore, the team did not fail to score in this match.
267	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, during the 1982 World Cup Qualifiers, Yugoslavia played two matches (row 6 and row 7) and scored a total of 7 goals (5-0 against Luxembourg and 2-1 against Denmark) while allowing 3 goals (1-1 against Luxembourg and 2-1 against Denmark). Therefore, the total goals scored by Yugoslavia is 7, and the total goals allowed by Yugoslavia is 3, which supports the statement provided.
268	I apologize, but based on the information provided in the table, I cannot support or refute that statement. The table only shows the dates of the games played by Bradford City A.F.C. during the 2008-09 season and doesn't provide enough information to determine if March is featured more often in the date than any other month.
269	I have checked the table and the statement "five of the games listed ended with 0 - 0 result" is refuted by the information presented in the table. There are only three games listed with a 0-0 result: the 22nd game against Chester City, the 24th game against Shrewsbury Town, and the 32nd game against Darlington. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
270	Sorry, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the information in the table. The table only provides information about the dates, opponents, venues, results, and attendance of each game in the season. It does not provide any information about the point total that Bradford City accumulated against each opponent.
271	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 12, 13 and 34 in the table show that three of the games had an attendance in the 3000s:- Row 12: Darlington (away): 3034- Row 13: Grimsby Town (away): 4470- Row 34: Notts County (away): 5138 Therefore, we can conclude that the statement "three of the total games featured had an attendance in the 3000s" is supported by the information presented in the table for the 2008-09 Bradford City A.F.C. season.
272	The statement you provided is supported by the table. According to the table, Bradford City played against Port Vale twice during the 2008-09 season. The first game was played on September 6, 2008, and was an away game that Bradford City won 2-0. The second game was played on March 21, 2009, at home, and Bradford City lost to Port Vale 0-1.
273	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is not supported. While there are 13 games played in March and April combined, March (10 games) is not featured more often in the date than any other month. In fact, October (14 games) is the month that appears most frequently in the table, followed by August (4 games) and November (4 games).
274	The statement that "five of the games listed ended with a 0 - 0 result and 3 with a result of 5 - 0" is not supported by the information in the provided table. In the given table for the 2008-09 Bradford City A.F.C. season, there is only one 0 - 0 draw and two 5 - 0 victories listed. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
275	Sorry, I have reviewed the table and I cannot confirm whether the statement is true or false since the table does not contain information on the number of points gained by Bradford City AFC in each match. The table only provides information on the date, opponent, venue, result, and attendance for each match played by Bradford City AFC during the 2008-2009 season.
276	The statement is incorrect based on the information presented in the table. There were actually 9 games with attendances in the 3000s, and 11 games with attendances in the 12000s.
277	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Bradford City played against Port Vale twice during the 2008-09 season. The first game was on 13 September 2008, with Bradford City winning 2-0, and the second game was on 28 March 2009, with Port Vale winning 1-0.
278	The statement "Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina" is supported by the information in the table. Michael Phelps won a total of 22 Olympic medals (rows 34-38), while Larisa Latynina won a total of 18 Olympic medals (rows 28-33). Therefore, Michael Phelps has four more Olympic medals than Larisa Latynina.
279	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Carl Osburn won eight Olympic medals, while Larisa Latynina won a total of 18 Olympic medals, which is seven more than Osburn.
280	The statement that Robert Garrett and James Connolly represent the same country is supported by the table. Both athletes are listed as representing the United States in the athletics events of the 1896 Summer Olympics.
281	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. Athlete Hermann Weingärtner from Germany received a medal for Pommel Horse in the 1896 Olympics.
282	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Rows 11-15 show that Carl Schuhmann and Hermann Weingärtner from Germany each received medals in gymnastics, with Hermann Weingärtner receiving multiple medals. Additionally, row 28 shows that Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union received medals in gymnastics, with a total of six medals listed in rows 28-33. Therefore, three athletes received medals in gymnastics: Carl Schuhmann, Hermann Weingärtner, and Larisa Latynina.
283	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Michael Phelps has won a total of 28 Olympic medals (23 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), while Larisa Latynina has won a total of 18 Olympic medals (9 gold, 5 silver, 4 bronze). Therefore, Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina.
284	That statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Carl Osburn has won a total of 11 Olympic medals, while Larisa Latynina has won a total of 18 Olympic medals. Therefore, Larisa Latynina has 7 more medals than Carl Osburn, not 7 less.
285	Yes, that statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 2 of the table shows that James Connolly represented the United States, while row 5 shows that Robert Garrett also represented the United States. However, row 8 shows that Robert Garrett won a medal for the Standing Long Jump while representing the United States, which supports the idea that the two athletes represented different countries at different times.
286	Refuted. Athlete Hermann Weingärtner from Germany received a silver medal for Pommel Horse in the 1896 Olympic Games, as shown in row 13 of the table. Hence, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
287	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. The athlete Hermann Weingärtner won three medals in the gymnastics events at the 1896 Olympic Games, including a gold medal in the horizontal bar. Additionally, Larisa Latynina won eight medals in gymnastics between 1960 and 1964, including four gold medals, as well as several silver and bronze medals. Therefore, the statement that none of the athletes received medals in gymnastics is not supported by the information presented in the table.
288	The statement appears to be supported by the information in the table. There are three translators listed in the 100's frequency range: W264BF at 100.7 MHz, W276BM at 103.1 MHz, and W293AL at 106.5 MHz.There are also three translators listed in the 90's frequency range: W221BY at 92.1 MHz, W240BJ at 95.9 MHz, and W223AU at 92.5 MHz. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
289	The statement "all of the translators are class d" is supported by the table. All of the entries in the "Class" column indicate "D."
290	Refuted. The statement "all of the call signs for each translator include three digit numbers that begin with the number 2" is refuted by the information presented in the table. While some of the call signs in the table have numbers that begin with 2 (e.g. W221BY, W223AU), not all of them do. For example, W264BF, W240BJ, W276BM, and W293AL all have call signs that begin with numbers other than 2. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
291	The statement "w293al has the highest erp w, whereas w264bf has the lowest erp w" is supported by the table. According to the table, the ERP (Effective Radiated Power) values are given in watts, and w293al has the highest ERP value of 80 watts, whereas w264bf has the lowest ERP value of 2 watts. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information in the table.
292	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is supported. The table includes information regarding 7 translators, of which 3 are licensed to cities in Illinois and 3 are licensed to cities in Indiana. Therefore, each state has 3 translators.
293	I apologize, but I cannot confirm if the statement "there is a 5 MHz frequency change range" is supported or refuted by the table you provided. The table only shows the call sign, frequency in MHz, city of license, ERP (Effective Radiated Power), class, and FCC information for various radio stations. There is no information about a frequency change range in the table. Perhaps you could provide me with more information or context to better understand the statement you are asking about.
294	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the translators are class D and C" is supported. All of the entries in the "class" column of the table indicate that the translators are Class D (represented by the letter "D" in the table). However, there is no entry in the table that indicates that any of the translators are Class C, so that part of the statement is not supported. Overall, the statement is only partially supported by the given table.
295	The statement "the number 2 is the only erp w" is refuted by the table. Indeed, there are several ERP W values in the table that are not equal to 2, such as 38, 10, 19, and 80. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
296	The statement is supported by the table. According to the information provided in the table, both w293al and w264bf have a class of "d" and their respective erp w is 80 and 2, which means they do not have the same erp w.
297	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Englewood, Illinois has two translators" is supported. Row 3 of the table shows that the call sign W264BF operates on a frequency of 100.7 MHz and is licensed to Englewood, Illinois, while row 2 does not mention Englewood but lists a call sign W221BY that operates on a frequency of 92.1 MHz and is licensed to Elgin, Illinois. Therefore, neither of these translators are licensed to Englewood. However, row 3 also shows that W264BF is the only translator listed in the table for Englewood, Illinois. So while Englewood only has one translator listed in the table, the statement that it has two translators is refuted.
298	According to the table, the Australian Open and French Open did not have the same results in 1996 and 1990. In 1990, Katrina Adams did not reach the third round at the Australian Open (1R) but reached the third round at the French Open (3R). In 1996, she did not compete in the Australian Open (A) but reached the quarter-finals at the French Open (QF). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
299	According to the table, Katrina Adams participated in the US Open tournament in 1986 and 1999. In 1986, she lost in the first round, and in 1999, she lost in the first round as well. Therefore, the statement "the US Open had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999" is supported by the table.
300	The statement "Wimbledon had only one 'A' result during the years 1986 to 1999" is not supported by the table. It can be seen from the table that Wimbledon had four 'A' results during this period: in 1986, 1991, 1995, and 1998. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
301	The statement "each tournament had the same result in the years 1990 and 1999" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table because there are different results for each tournament in those years. For example:- In the Australian Open, Katrina Adams had a result of 3r (third round) in 1990 and a result of 1r (first round) in 1999.- In the French Open, Katrina Adams had a result of 3r (third round) in 1990 and a result of 1r (first round) in 1999.- In Wimbledon, Katrina Adams had a result of 3r (third round) in 1990 and a result of 1r (first round) in 1999.- In the US Open, Katrina Adams had a result of 3r (third round) in 1990 and a result of 1r (first round) in 1999.Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table provided.
302	The statement "the Australian Open had three a results and Wimbledon had only one" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, Katrina Adams had 'a' result for the Australian Open in 1986, 1991, and 1996, which means she did not participate in those years. On the other hand, she had only one 'a' result for Wimbledon, which means she did not play in that tournament in 1986.
303	According to the table, Katrina Adams competed in grand slam tournaments every year from 1986 to 1999, and the table provides information regarding her performance in each grand slam tournament for each year. In 1996, Adams did not participate in the Australian Open (represented by "a" in the table), but her performance in the French Open was a quarterfinal (represented by "qf" in the table). Therefore, the statement "the results in 1996 is different for Australian Open and French Open" is supported by the information presented in the table.
304	The statement is supported by the table. In 1986, according to the table, Katrina Adams had a 1r result in the US Open, while in 1999, she had a 3r result in the same tournament. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
305	According to the table provided, Katrina Adams did not make it past the 1st round at Wimbledon in 1986 or 1999; in 1986, she did not compete in the tournament, and in 1999, she lost in the 1st round. Therefore, the statement "the Wimbledon had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999" is refuted by the table, as Katrina Adams' performance at Wimbledon in 1986 was different from her performance in 1999.
306	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the US Open had a different result in the years 1990 and 1999" is supported. In 1990, Katrina Adams lost in the third round of the US Open, while in 1999, she lost in the first round. This means that her performance in the US Open was different in those two years.
307	Based on the table provided, the statement "the Australian Open had the same results as Wimbledon had" is not supported by the information in the table. While Katrina Adams did not compete in the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996, she did compete in Wimbledon those years and had different results in each tournament. For example, in 1991 she did not advance past the first round in the Australian Open, but she reached the quarterfinals in Wimbledon.
308	Based on the table provided, the statement "in 1962, the Victorian Football League season took place on 23 June" cannot be wholly supported or refuted. The table shows the matches that took place on 23 June 1962, but it doesn't explicitly state that the entire VFL season took place on that day. It's possible that the VFL season consisted of matches on other dates as well.
309	The statement "the game between Footscray and Carlton was played at Princes Park" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the game between Carlton and Footscray was played at Princes Park, as shown in row 5: | Princes Park  | 12.9 (81) | Footscray | 9.10 (64) | Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
310	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, the game between South Melbourne and Richmond had a crowd of 17,000, while the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne had a crowd of 8,470, which is fewer than the former. Hence, the statement is false, and it is refuted by the information presented in the table.
311	The statement, "the 1962 vfl season was played by a total of 12 different teams", is not supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. The table only shows the results of six matches that were played on June 23, 1962, during the VFL (Victorian Football League) season. The table does not provide information about the total number of teams that played in the 1962 VFL season. However, to answer the statement, the 1962 VFL season consisted of a total of 12 teams according to historical records.
312	The statement "Collingwood scored more points than Fitzroy in their 1962 VFL match" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Collingwood scored 10.14 (74) while Fitzroy scored 9.11 (65). Therefore, Collingwood scored more points than Fitzroy in their 1962 VFL match.
313	I'm sorry, but the information in the table provided does not support or refute the statement "in 1962, the VFL began in July." The table only provides information about the scores, teams, venues, and dates of games played during a specific round in June of 1962. It does not provide information about the start date of the VFL season in 1962.
314	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that on June 23, 1962, the game between Carlton and Footscray was played at Princes Park, and the game between Collingwood and Fitzroy was played at Victoria Park. However, there is no indication that the game between Footscray and Fitzroy was played at Windy Hill.
315	I'm sorry, but the statement "the match between South Melbourne and Richmond drew the smallest crowds of the day" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the smallest crowd of the day was at the Arden Street Oval, where North Melbourne played Hawthorn. The attendance for that match was recorded as 8,470. The match between South Melbourne and Richmond, on the other hand, was played at the Lake Oval and drew a crowd of 17,000 people, which is higher than the crowd at the Arden Street Oval. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
316	The statement "Collingwood scored more points than Hawthorn in the 1962 VFL match" cannot be checked against the provided table, as the table does not contain any information about a match played between Collingwood and Hawthorn in the 1962 VFL season. Therefore, the statement cannot be either supported or refuted by the table.
317	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Harry Schell drove for the entrant Ecurie Bleue, while Philippe Etancelin drove for a private entrant.
318	The statement is supported by the table. Row 20 shows that Ecurie Espadon was the entrant, SVA-Fiat was the constructor, and SVA 1500 was the chassis. Row 19 shows that Scuderia Ambrosiana was the entrant, Maserati was the constructor, and Maserati 4CLT-48 was the chassis.
319	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix, the entrant for Prince Bira, who drove a Maserati with a l4s engine, was Enrico Plate. This information can be found in row 16, where the driver is listed as "Prince Bira", the entrant is listed as "Enrico Plate", the constructor is listed as "Maserati", the chassis is listed as "Maserati 4CLT - 48", the engine is listed as "Maserati L4S", and the tire is "P".
320	The statement is supported by the table. From the table, it can be seen that Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin were private entrants who drove for Maserati and Talbot-Lago respectively. Toni Branca used Pirelli tires (marked as "p" in the table), while Philippe Étancelin used Dunlop tires (marked as "d" in the table). Therefore, the statement that "the entrant was private on two occasions with the drivers being Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin with the tyres being P and D" is accurate according to the table.
321	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Peter Whitehead drove for Scuderia Ferrari and used a Ferrari 125 with a Ferrari V12s engine. The tires used by Whitehead were P.Similarly, Luigi Villoresi also drove for Scuderia Ferrari and used a Ferrari 125 with a Ferrari V12s engine. The tires used by Villoresi were also P, as per the information in the table.
322	I apologize, but based on the information provided in the table, I cannot confirm or refute the statement. The table only provides information on the drivers, entrants, constructors, chassis, engines, and tires used in the Swiss Grand Prix of 1950. It does not provide any specific information regarding which entrant was associated with which driver for this particular race.
323	The statement appears to be refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Rudi Fischer was driving for "Ecurie Espadon," but the entrant's car was listed as "SVA - Fiat," and the chassis was "SVA 1500." Therefore, it seems that "Ecurie Espadon" was not the entrant for Talbot-Lago T26C models, but rather for SVA - Fiat.
324	Looking at the table, we can see that the driver with the Maserati L4S engine was Nello Pagani, racing for Scuderia Achille Varzi. However, the driver with the Alfa Romeo L8S engine and representing SA Alfa Romeo was Nino Farina. Therefore, the statement "when the engine was maserati l4s and the driver was nino farina" is refuted by the table since Nino Farina wasn't driving with the Maserati L4S engine.
325	The statement is partially supported by the table. The entrant column shows that Harry Schell was driving for Ecurie Bleue, which was a private team. However, Johnny Claes was driving for Ecurie Belge, which was not a private team. Therefore, the statement is only partially correct.
326	According to the table, there is a row (row 11) that matches this statement. It shows that the driver was Raymond Sommer, the entrant was Scuderia Ferrari, the constructor was Ferrari, the chassis was Ferrari 125, the engine was Ferrari V12s, and the tire choice was P. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
327	Correct! The statement "the majority of the athletes with the longest mark are from the United States" is supported by the information in the table. Of the top 5 longest long jump marks listed in the table, 4 of them were made by American athletes, including the world record holder Mike Powell at 8.95 meters. Additionally, of the top 10 longest long jump marks in the table, 7 were made by American athletes. Therefore, the table shows that the United States has produced the most top-level long jumpers.
328	According to the table, Erick Walder had a wind of 2.0 meters per second, whereas Bob Beamon had a wind of 2.0 meters per second. Therefore, the statement "Erick Walder and Bob Beamon had the same wind" is supported by the information in the table.
329	The statement is true. Looking at the table, we can see that only four athletes had a mark greater than 29 feet (8.84 meters) in the long jump, which are Mike Powell, Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis, and Robert Emmiyan.
330	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Bob Beamon is listed in row 3 as the athlete who set the record for the long jump with a mark of 8.90m (29ft 2¼in) with a wind measurement of 2.0 in Mexico City on October 18, 1968. All the other athletes listed in the table, including Mike Powell who set the current world record, set their records at a later date than Bob Beamon. Therefore, the statement that Bob Beamon is the athlete who set his long jump record the longest time ago is true based on the information in the table.
331	The statement "the most recent long jump record was set by Dwight Phillips" is not supported by the table. While Dwight Phillips is listed in row 8 as having jumped 8.74 meters, or 28 feet 8 inches, at the Eugene venue on June 7, 2009, his distance is not the current long jump record. As per the table, the current long jump record of 8.95 meters, or 29 feet 4¼ inches, was set by Mike Powell of the United States in Tokyo on August 30, 1991.
332	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Of the 11 longest long jump marks listed in the table, 7 were achieved by athletes from the United States. Mike Powell, Bob Beamon, and Carl Lewis all set world records with their jumps, and they are all from the United States.
333	The statement is not entirely true based on the information in the table. While it is true that most of the athletes listed have a wind reading of either 0.3 or 0.2, there are a few exceptions to this. As you correctly noted, Eric Walder and Bob Beamon have a different wind reading from the other athletes. Beamon's wind reading is 2.0, while Walder's is 2.0 as well. However, there are a few other athletes on the table who also have different wind readings from the rest. For instance, Robert Emmiyan has a wind reading of 1.9, while Loúis Tsátoumas has a wind reading of 1.6. Therefore, the statement that "all athletes have the same wind except Eric Walder and Bob Beamon" is refuted by the table, as there are other athletes with different wind readings as well.
334	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, there were only three athletes who had a mark of at least 28 feet in the long jump: Larry Myricks, Erick Walder, and Dwight Phillips. Their marks were all 28 feet, 8 inches or 8.74 meters.
335	The statement "Bob Beamon has recently set his long jump record" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Bob Beamon set the record on October 18, 1968, which is over 50 years ago. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
336	The statement "Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record" is refuted by the table. As per the table, Bob Beamon held the long jump record with a jump of 8.90 meters (29ft2¼in) achieved on October 18, 1968, in Mexico City.
337	Based on the given table, we can see that Keith Miller took 13 wickets while Ernie Toshack took 11 wickets. Both of them played a different number of matches. Keith Miller played in all five matches, while Ernie Toshack only played in four matches. Therefore, the statement "the bowler with 13 wickets appeared in more matches than the bowler with 11 wickets" is supported by the table.
338	The statement is supported by the table. Both Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes Series, but Ray Lindwall had a better average of 19.62, while Bill Johnston had an average of 23.33.
339	The statement is refuted by the table. While Bill Johnston did take 27 wickets, Alec Bedser, a player from England, took 18 wickets which is less than Bill Johnston. Therefore, at least one England player took fewer wickets than Bill Johnston.
340	The statement "Jim Laker played in fewer matches than any of the Australian players" is supported by the table. As per the table, Jim Laker played in only three matches, which is fewer than any of the Australian players who all played in five matches each. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
341	The statement "Alec Bedser had the best bowling average of any England player" is supported by the information in the table. As per the given table, Alec Bedser had an average of 38.22 in the 1948 ashes series, which was the best among all England players mentioned in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
342	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Keith Miller from Australia took 13 wickets in 5 matches, while Ernie Toshack, also from Australia, took 11 wickets in 4 matches. Therefore, the bowler with 13 wickets (Keith Miller) appeared in more matches than the bowler with 11 wickets (Ernie Toshack). Since the statement says the opposite, it is refuted by the table.
343	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ray Lindwall took 27 wickets in 5 matches with an average of 19.62, while Bill Johnston also took 27 wickets in 5 matches but with a better average of 23.33. Therefore, Ray Lindwall took a higher number of wickets than Bill Johnston but had a worse bowling average.
344	The statement "all of the England players took as many wickets as Bill Johnston" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Bill Johnston took 27 wickets in 5 matches, while the highest wicket-taker among the England players is Alec Bedser with 18 wickets in 5 matches. The other England players listed in the table have taken fewer wickets than Bill Johnston. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table, but it is refuted.
345	The statement "Jim Laker played in more matches than any of the Australian players" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Jim Laker played in 3 matches, while four Australian players (Ray Lindwall, Bill Johnston, Keith Miller, Ernie Toshack) played in 5 matches each. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
346	The statement "among the players in df position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals" is supported by the table. According to the table, Dave Sutton played in the defense position, and he scored six goals in the league that season, which is the most among all the players listed in the table who played in the defense position. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
347	The statement that "the two players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart" is supported by the table. According to the table, Malcolm Brown played 46 league matches and Peter Hart played 46 league matches as well, which makes them the two players with the highest number of league appearances for Huddersfield Town in the 1979-80 season.
348	Yes, the statement "the player with the highest number of league goals is Ian Robins" is supported by the information in the table. Ian Robins scored 25 goals in the league during the 1979-80 season, which is the highest number of goals scored by any player in the league that season.
349	According to the table, the player with the highest number of total goals is Ian Robins, who scored a total of 27 goals throughout the season - 25 in league games, and 2 in FA Cup matches. This means that the statement "the player with the highest number of total goals is Ian Robins" is supported by the information presented in the table.
350	The statement "the only player that doesn't have 0 FA Cup goals is Peter Hart" is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the "fa cup goals" column, we can see that only Peter Hart has scored at least one goal in the FA Cup during the 1979-80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season. All other players listed have a value of 0 in that column.
351	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Dave Sutton played as a defender (df) during the 1979-80 season for Huddersfield Town F.C. and scored a total of 6 league goals, which is the highest among all the defenders in the team. Therefore, it can be concluded that Dave Sutton has scored the most league goals in df positions for Huddersfield Town F.C. during the 1979-80 season.
352	The statement "Chris Topping and Dave Sutton have the highest league apps" is incorrect based on the information presented in the table. While Dave Sutton played in all 46 league matches during the 1979-80 season, Chris Topping only played in 13 league matches. Therefore, Dave Sutton has the highest number of league apps in the Huddersfield Town F.C. team during the 1979-80 season.
353	Refuted. Looking at the table, we can see that Tommy Smith played 0 league games and did not score any league goals. Therefore, he does not have the highest number of league goals. The player with the highest number of league goals is Ian Robins, who played in 45 league games and scored 25 goals.
354	The statement is refuted by the table. Ian Robins has the highest number of total goals with 27, but Chris Topping has 0 goals in total. Therefore, there's only one player with the highest number of total goals, and that's Ian Robins.
355	Based on the information in the table, the statement "two other players apart from Peter Hart have FA Cup goals" is true. Peter Hart has one FA Cup goal, while Ian Robins and Dave Sutton each have two FA Cup goals, which means there are two other players apart from Peter Hart with FA Cup goals, confirming the statement.
356	The statement is true. According to the table provided, the Toronto Blue Jays played in a total of 8 games with an attendance greater than 5000 in May of the 1991 season (rows 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, and 19).
357	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. The Toronto Blue Jays played against the Rangers three times in May during the 1991 season. The scores and details of those games are listed in rows 2, 7, and 8 of the table.
358	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the Toronto Blue Jays won two of the last three games they played in May 1991" is supported. The Blue Jays played three games from May 29 to May 31, with two of those games against the Oakland Athletics and one game against the Los Angeles Angels. They won two out of those three games, with their May 29 and May 31 games resulting in victories, while the May 30 game resulted in a loss. Therefore, the statement that the Toronto Blue Jays won two of the last three games they played in May 1991 is supported by the information in the table.
359	Refuted. Based on the table provided, the game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Rangers on May 1st, with an attendance of 33,439. The game against the Royals on May 3rd had an attendance of 20,809, which was higher than the game against the Rangers.
360	That statement is supported by the table. As shown in the table, the Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Angels on May 24th, and then went on to lose the next two games against the Angels on May 25th and May 26th, resulting in three consecutive losses between the 25th and 28th of May 1991.
361	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. There is no game in the table where the attendance was less than 5000. The lowest attendance listed in the table is 20809, which is still significantly higher than 5000. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is false.
362	Based on the table provided, the statement "The Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels three times in May during the 1991 season" is supported by the table. Rows 22 through 24 in the table all show games played against the Angels, with the dates of May 24th, May 25th, and May 26th. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information in the table.
363	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the Toronto Blue Jays lost two of the last three games they played in May 1991" is supported. The Blue Jays' record in the last three games they played in May (May 29, May 30, and May 31) was 1-2, with an 8-3 loss and an 8-6 loss to the Athletics and a 5-1 win over the Angels. Therefore, they lost two of their last three games in May 1991.
364	Refuted. The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Rangers on May 1 with an attendance of 33,439. The attendance for the game against the Athletics is not the lowest one in May. It was played on May 20 with an attendance of 24,631.
365	Based on the table you provided, the statement that "the Toronto Blue Jays lost one consecutive games between the 25th and the 28th May 1991" is refuted. The table shows that the Toronto Blue Jays won a game on May 25 against the Angels (5-0) and then won two more games against the Angels and Athletics on May 26 and May 28, respectively. Therefore, they did not lose any consecutive games during that period.
366	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 in the table, the tournament took place on June 2nd, 2003, in Surbiton, Great Britain.
367	The statement "the tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was on April 16, 2007" is supported by the table. The information in row 6 shows that the tournament was held in Cardiff, Great Britain and the date mentioned is April 16, 2007. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
368	The statement is supported by the table. In row 2 of the table, it shows that on June 2, 2003, Alex Bogdanovic competed in the Surbiton tournament in Great Britain on grass surface. His opponent in the final was Wesley Moodie, and the score was 4-6, 7-6(2), 1-6. Therefore, the statement that Wesley Moodie was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on June 2nd, 2003 is supported by the information presented in the table.
369	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the tournament that took place on April 26, 2004, was in Glasgow, Great Britain F1, and the surface was carpet. Therefore, the statement is true and is supported by the information presented in the table.
370	The statement "rik de voest was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 8th, 2013" is supported by the information presented in row 9 of the table, which indicates that Alex Bogdanovic played as the opponent against Rik de Voest on April 8th, 2013, in Oklahoma City, USA F9, on a hard surface, with a score of 3-6, 2-6.
371	The statement "the April 26th 2004 tournament took place in Surbiton, Great Britain" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the April 26th, 2004 tournament was held in Glasgow, Great Britain, not Surbiton.
372	The statement "the tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was on April 4, 2011" is supported by the information in the table. Row 6 of the table states that the tournament was held in Cardiff, Great Britain and the date of the tournament was April 16, 2007, which is not the same as April 4, 2011. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
373	The statement "Alex Bogdanovic has never played against Wesley Moodie yet" is refuted by the table. According to row 2 of the table, on 2 June 2003, Alex Bogdanovic played against Wesley Moodie in the final of the Surbiton tournament in Great Britain. The match went to three sets, with Bogdanovic winning the second set tiebreak 7-2, but ultimately losing 4-6, 7-6(2), 1-6. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
374	According to the table, the tournament that took place on April 26, 2004, was held in Glasgow, Great Britain, on a carpet surface. Therefore, the statement "the tournament that took place on April 26, 2004, was on grass" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
375	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, on April 4th, 2011, Alex Bogdanovic played against Arnau Brugués-Davi and lost with a score of 3-6, 1-6. Rik de Voest was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 8th, 2013, and he also defeated Bogdanovic with a score of 3-6, 2-6.
376	According to the table, three out of four players mentioned in the statement are from the United States. Ben Curtis, J.B. Holmes, and Steve Flesch are from the United States, while David Toms is also mentioned, but his country of origin is not the United States. Therefore, the statement is partially supported by the table.
377	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 4 shows that Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, row 10 shows that Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, and row 7 shows that Charlie Wi is from South Korea. Therefore, the statement is accurate according to the given table.
378	The statement "J B Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tied for second place with -1 to par" is supported by the table. Row 3 and 4 show that J B Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden both had a score of 209 with a to-par of -1, which means they tied for second place at the 2008 PGA Championship.
379	The statement is supported by the table. In row 5, it shows that Sergio García scored 69 + 73 + 69 = 211, which is +1 above par. Similarly, in row 6, Pádraig Harrington scored 71 + 74 + 66 = 211, which is also +1 above par. In row 7, Charlie Wi scored 70 + 70 + 71 = 211, which again is +1 above par. Therefore, the statement that Sergio García, Pádraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi tied for 4th place with +1 to par is supported by the information in the table.
380	The statement is supported by the table. Row 12 shows that David Toms from the United States scored +3, and row 13 shows that Camilo Villegas from Colombia also scored +3. Therefore, the statement that "Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States tied for 9th place with +3 to par" is true based on the information presented in the table.
381	The statement "Charlie Wi and Aaron Baddeley are from the United States" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Charlie Wi is from South Korea and Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, not the United States.
382	The statement that Henrik Stenson is from Australia, Aaron Baddeley is from South Korea, and Charlie Wi is from Sweden is refuted by the table. From the table we can see that:1. Henrik Stenson is from Sweden (row 4).2. Aaron Baddeley is from Australia (row 10).3. Charlie Wi is from South Korea (row 7).Therefore, the statement is incorrect, as the nationalities of these players are different from what is stated.
383	I apologize, but the statement you provided is incorrect. The statement should be "J.B. Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tied for second place with -1 to par." According to the table, both J.B. Holmes and Henrik Stenson finished with a score of 209, which is 1 stroke under par. They both finished in a tie for 2nd place, not 3rd place. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
384	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not entirely accurate. According to the table, Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi tied for fourth place with a score of +1 to par (row 5, 6, and 7). So, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
385	I'm sorry, but the statement "Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States tied for eighth place with +4 to par." is refuted by the table.According to the table, Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States both finished tied for ninth place with a score of +3 to par. Therefore, the statement that they finished tied for eighth place with +4 to par is incorrect.
386	The table provides information about the different models of the tam tank and their respective specifications, including their weapons, weight, speed, horsepower, etc. There is no information in the table that directly compares the speed of the VCTP with the VCRT or their respective weapons. Therefore, the statement cannot be neither supported nor refuted by the table.
387	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table,- The first row shows the different types of vehicles or tanks.- The second row shows their corresponding weight in tons.- The third row shows the type of weapon mounted on each vehicle/tank.- The fourth row shows the range in km/mi.- The fifth row shows the specific power in horsepower per ton.- The sixth row shows the maximum speed of each vehicle/tank.As per the statement, the "vca 40t (44.1tons)" corresponds to a weight of 40 tons, and "155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer" corresponds to a mortar. Similarly, "vctm" corresponds to the weight of "26t (28.7tons)", and "120 mm (4.72in) mortar" is mounted on the vehicle or tank. This information is in line with the data provided in the table, which shows that the "vca 40t (44.1tons)" has a weight of 40 tons, and the "155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer" is mounted on it. Similarly, the "vctm" has a weight of "26t (28.7tons)", and the "120 mm (4.72in) mortar" is mounted on it. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
388	I'm sorry, but it's not possible to determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table. The table provides information about six different types of tam tanks, labeled vctp, vca 155, vctm, vcpc, vclc, and vcrt. However, the table does not clearly indicate which row corresponds to which type of tank, which makes it difficult to determine which data points correspond to the vctp and vca 155 tanks. Additionally, the table does not provide information about the speed of any of the tanks in terms of kilometers per hour or miles per hour, so it's not possible to determine whether the statement that the vctp has a speed of 55 km/h (34 mph) is supported or refuted by the table.
389	I'm sorry, but I'm having a hard time understanding the statement you provided. Can you please rephrase it?
390	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is supported. The table shows that the VCPC and VCRT values for the 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun are the same for both the VCTP with a 20 mm RH-202 autocannon and the VCRT with 160 mm or 350 mm rockets. Additionally, the VCPC and VCRT values for the VCTP with a speed of 75 km/h are the same as those for the VCRT with the same speed. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data in the table.
391	The statement "the vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon does not have 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun as the vcrt" is supported by the information in the table. From the table, it can be seen that the vctp has a 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon as its primary armament and does not have a 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun as the vcrt. The vcrt for the vctp is listed as 32t (35.3tons), which indicates that it is a recovery vehicle rather than a combat vehicle, and therefore, it does not have an autocannon or a machine gun as its armament.
392	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that the VCA (Variable Compression Artillery) vehicle with a weight of 40t has a VCTM (Variable Compression Traction Motor) value of 26t, and the vehicle is equipped with a 155mm L/41 howitzer with a VCTM value not mentioned in the table. Also, the table shows that the VCTM value of the vehicle equipped with a 120mm (4.72in) mortar is 28.8hp/t, and the weight of the vehicle is not mentioned in the table.
393	According to the table, the information for the vctp 24hp / t (23hp / ton) is as follows:- VCA: 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer- Top speed: 75 km/h (47 mph)Therefore, the statement "vctp 24hp / t (23hp / ton) has a vca 155 of 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer, and not 55 km/h (34 mph)" is refuted by the information in the table, as the actual top speed of the vctp vehicle is 75 km/h, not 55 km/h.
394	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. The row for vclc indicates a weight of 32t (35.3 tons) and a VCPC of 25t (27.6 tons). The row also indicates that it is equipped with either a 160mm (6.3in) or 350mm (13.8in) rocket system and has a VCRT of 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. Therefore, the statement that "vclc 32t (35.3 tons) has the same VCPC but vclc 160mm (6.3in) or 350mm (13.8in) rockets has a VCRT of 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun" is supported by the information in the table.
395	I'm sorry, but it's difficult to determine whether the statement is true or false, as it is not entirely clear. However, I can provide you with the relevant information from the table to help clarify:- The table contains information about six different vehicles, labeled from vca 155 to vcrt.- Each row of the table provides information about a specific aspect of these vehicles, such as their weight, weapon systems, engine power, or speed. The information is presented in columns labeled with abbreviations such as vctp, vca, vctm, vcpc, vclc, and vcrt.- For example, the first row of the table provides information about the weight of each vehicle, expressed in metric tons (t) and imperial tons.- The second row provides information about the primary weapon system of each vehicle, named as follows: 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon, 155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer, 120 mm (4.72in) mortar, 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun, 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets, and 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun.- The third row provides additional details about each weapon system.- The fourth row provides information about the maximum range of each vehicle, expressed in kilometers (km) or miles (mi).- The fifth row provides information about the engine power of each vehicle, expressed as horsepower per metric ton (hp / t) or horsepower per imperial ton (hp / ton).- The sixth row provides information about the maximum speed of each vehicle, expressed in kilometers per hour (km / h) or miles per hour (mph).Without further context or clarification, it's not clear what the statement is referring to when it mentions the vcpc and vctp of the machine gun being the same as the vcrt of the autocannon, or the vcpc and vcrt of the vehicles at 75 km / h being the same as the vctp at 75 km / h. Please provide additional details or context, or rephrase the statement in a clearer way, so I can help you better.
396	The statement is supported by the table. In the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti," the director was Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond. (See row 2: no| -, title| director, where it lists Amy Sherman-Palladino as the director for that episode.)
397	I'm sorry, but the statement "Amy Sherman-Palladino was the director of four episodes in 2003" is not supported by the table. The table provides information about each episode in chronological order of the original air date, but it does not indicate the number of episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino in 2003. However, the table does show that Amy Sherman-Palladino was the director of at least three episodes in 2003, namely:- Episode 1 "Ballrooms and Biscotti" (original air date: September 23, 2003)- Episode 6 "An Affair to Remember" (original air date: October 28, 2003)- Episode 20 "Luke Can See Her Face" (original air date: May 4, 2004)It's possible that Amy Sherman-Palladino also directed a fourth episode in 2003 or that she directed other episodes in other years, but this information is not provided in the table.
398	I apologize for the error in the statement. Here is the corrected statement: "Amy Sherman-Palladino directed the same number of episodes as Daniel Palladino." This statement is supported by the table. Both directors are listed as having directed an equal number of episodes in the table, which is six episodes each.
399	I apologize for my mistake earlier. After reviewing the table, I found the following information:- Amy Sherman-Palladino directed the following episodes: "Ballrooms and Biscotti," "The Hobbit, the Sofa and Digger Stiles," "An Affair to Remember," "Ted Koppel's Big Night Out," and "Luke Can See Her Face."- Daniel Palladino directed the following episodes: "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale," "The Festival of Living Art," "Die, Jerk," "The Nanny and the Professor," "A Family Matter," "Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist," "Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!," "Afterboom," and "Last Week Fights, This Week Tights."From the information in the table, it appears that Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino did not direct any episodes of Gilmore Girls together. Thus, the statement "Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino directed two episodes together" is refuted by the table.
400	I'm sorry, but I must point out that the statement you provided is inaccurate. The table you provided does not contain any viewership data for episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef." Therefore, it is impossible to determine if episode 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 1.6 million less viewers than episode 69. However, I can tell you that according to the table, episode 67 had 3.9 million viewers while episode 69's viewership is unknown.
401	The statement is inaccurate. In the table provided, the writer of the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" in the show "Gilmore Girls" is listed as Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
402	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table indicates that the first episode of the series from 2003, titled "Ballrooms and Biscotti", was directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino. So, she directed a single episode in 2003.
403	The statement is not supported by the table. Daniel Palladino directed five episodes, while Amy Sherman-Palladino directed four episodes. Therefore, Daniel Palladino directed one episode more than Amy Sherman - Palladino did.
404	The statement "amy sherman - palladino and daniel palladino directed more than three episodes together" is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, amy sherman - palladino and daniel palladino are listed as writers and directors of several episodes, but they did not direct more than three episodes together. They directed one episode each individually: "ballrooms and biscotti," "the lorelais' first day at Yale," "the hobbit, the sofa and digger stiles," "a family matter," "the incredible sinking Lorelais," "tick, tick, tick, boom!," and "last week fights, this week tights."
405	Based on the information provided in the given table, the statement "number 67 titled the lorelais' first day at yale had more viewers than episode 69 titled chicken or beef" is refuted. According to the "us viewers (million)" column in the table, the viewership for episode 67 "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" was 3.9 million, while the viewership for episode 69 "Chicken or Beef" was 5.5 million. Therefore, episode 69 had more viewers than episode 67, and the statement is not supported by the table.
406	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2, the call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama. According to row 3, the call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama. Therefore, both call signs don't have the same city of license.
407	The statement is supported by the table. The frequency in MHz for call sign W269AX and W273AE is indeed 101.7 FM and 102.5 FM, respectively.
408	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 5 shows that the call sign "w282ae" has a city of license of "macon, georgia." Similarly, row 6 shows that "w290ag" has a city of license of "griffin, georgia." Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the given table.
409	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, both W230AV in Gadsden, Alabama, and W269AX in Anniston, Alabama, have the same ERP W (effective radiated power) of 10 and are both classified as Class D FM stations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ERP W and the class for W230AV in Gadsden, Alabama, is the same as the ERP W and class for W269AX in Anniston, Alabama.
410	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, both w290ag and w282ae have an erp w of 27 and a class of D. Furthermore, w290ag is licensed in Griffin, Georgia, while w282ae is licensed in Macon, Georgia. Therefore, the statement that "the erp w and class for w290ag and w282ae is 27 and d for both, but one has a city of license of Macon, Georgia and the other has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia" is supported by the table.
411	The statement provided, "call sign w230av has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama, while the call sign w269x has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia," is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the call sign "W230AV" has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, while the call sign "W269AX" has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama. Therefore, the statement is incorrect as the cities of licenses mentioned in the table are different for both call signs.
412	The statement is refuted by the table. The frequency mhz for call sign w269ax is 101.7 fm, not 93.9 fm, and the frequency mhz for call sign w273ae is 102.5 fm, not 105.9 fm.
413	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the city of license for w282ae is Macon, Georgia, and the city of license for w290ag is Griffin, Georgia.
414	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. Both W230AV in Gadsden, Alabama, and W290AG in Griffin, Georgia have the same Class D and ERP of 27 watts, as per the table.
415	Actually, that statement is not accurate based on the information in the table. According to the table, the ERPs and classes for W230AV and W290AG are different. W230AV has an ERP of 10 W and class D, while W290AG has an ERP of 27 W and also class D. Therefore, the statement "the erp w and class for w290ag and w230av is 55 and d for both" is refuted by the information in the table.Additionally, the statement incorrectly claims that one of the stations has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama. However, both W230AV and W269AX in the table have a city of license of Gadsden and Anniston, respectively, but neither matches the statement. W230AV's city of license is Gadsden, Alabama and W290AG's city of license is Griffin, Georgia. Therefore, the statement "but one has a city of license of anniston, alabama and the other has a city of license of macon, georgia" is also refuted by the information in the table.
416	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided because the table does not provide information about individual medal winners or events in which medals were won. It only provides the total number of medals won by each nation in all events at the Asian Games. Therefore, we cannot determine whether both Pakistan and Yemen have won a single bronze medal for wushu based solely on this table.
417	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, China (CHN) has won 43 gold medals for Wushu at the Asian Games, while Iran (IRI) has won 4 gold medals for Wushu at the Asian Games. The difference between 43 and 4 is 39, which confirms that China has won 39 more gold medals than Iran for Wushu at the Asian Games.
418	Based on the information in the table, the statement is supported. In the "gold" column, the row for Singapore (sin) shows 0, meaning they have not won a gold medal in wushu at the Asian Games. The same is true for Mongolia (mgl), as their row also shows a 0 in the "gold" column.
419	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Philippines (PHI) and Macau (MAC) both received one gold medal and five silver medals for Wushu at the Asian Games. However, the Philippines received eight bronze medals while Macau received four bronze medals. Therefore, the Philippines have won 4 more bronze medals than Macau in wushu at the Asian Games.
420	The statement can be refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Hong Kong won a total of 15 medals in wushu (2 gold, 9 silver, and 4 bronze), while Thailand won a total of 11 medals in wushu (2 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, Hong Kong won 4 more medals than Thailand overall in wushu competition at the Asian Games.
421	Refuted. The table does not show that Pakistan and Yemen won any bronze medals in wushu at the Asian Games. In fact, according to the table, Pakistan won one silver and one bronze medal in other sports, while Yemen won one bronze medal in other sports as well. However, the table doesn't provide a breakdown of each country's medal performance in each sport, so it's possible that Pakistan and Yemen did win bronze medals in wushu at some point in the Asian Games, but it's not reflected in this table.
422	According to the table, China has won 43 gold medals for the Asian Games, while Iran has won 4 gold medals. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table - China has won 39 more gold medals than Iran for wushu at the Asian Games.
423	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the row for wushu, we can see that none of the three countries mentioned (Singapore, Mongolia, and Myanmar) have won a gold medal for wushu at the Asian Games. Myanmar has won one silver and two bronzes, Singapore has won five bronzes, and Mongolia has won three bronzes but no golds. Therefore, the statement is true.
424	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that both the Philippines and Macau have won 1 gold and 5 silver medals for wushu at the Asian Games. However, Macau has won 4 bronze medals, while the Philippines has won 8 bronze medals. Therefore, Macau has won 4 more bronze medals than the Philippines in wushu at the Asian Games.
425	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Hong Kong (HKG) has won 2 gold, 9 silver and 4 bronze medals whereas Thailand (THA) has won 2 gold, 3 silver and 6 bronze medals, which means that Hong Kong has won 2 more bronze medals than Thailand for wushu.
426	The statement that "Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points scored in two games during this period of the 2010-2011 season" is supported by the table. According to the table, Rodney Stuckey scored 25 points in the game against Milwaukee on March 1st and also scored 10 points against Minnesota on March 2nd, which makes him the highest scorer in both the games.
427	The statement is supported by the table. From rows 1 to 11 of the table, we can see that the Detroit Pistons lost six games during this period of their 2010-2011 season, specifically against Milwaukee, Minnesota, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Atlanta, and Miami. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
428	The statement, "the Detroit Pistons won by over ten points in three games during this period of their 2010 - 2011 season," is not supported by the table. The table shows that the Detroit Pistons won only one game during this period by over ten points, which was their match against the Toronto Raptors on March 16, with a score of 107-93. The Pistons also lost three games in overtime during this period, which may have led to confusion on the margin of victory in these games.
429	The statement appears to be supported by the table. According to the table, the game on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center had an attendance of 11,364, which is the lowest attendance for any game listed in the table. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Detroit Pistons had their lowest game attendance during this period of the 2010-2011 season on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center.
430	I apologize, but the assertion cannot be supported or refuted by the table. The table only provides information on the scores, high points, high rebounds, high assists, locations, attendance, and record for 12 games played by the Detroit Pistons in March 2011. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there were any tie instances for most rebounds among Detroit Pistons players during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season from this table.
431	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Rodney Stuckey was the highest scorer for the Detroit Pistons in only one game during the period covered by the table (row 2: March 1 vs. Milwaukee, where he scored 25 points). For all other games in this period, other players like Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, and Austin Daye were the highest scorers for the Pistons.
432	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the results from row 1 to row 13, it can be seen that the Detroit Pistons lost 8 games in this period: Milwaukee (March 1st), Minnesota (March 2nd), San Antonio (March 9th), Oklahoma City (March 11th), Denver (March 12th), Atlanta (March 20th), Miami (March 23rd), and Cleveland (March 25th).
433	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the Detroit Pistons only won one game by more than ten points during this period of the 2010-2011 season, which was against the Toronto Raptors on March 16th, with a score of 107-93. The Pistons lost six games during this period, and five of them went into overtime. Therefore, the statement that the Detroit Pistons won by over ten points in four games during this period of their 2010-2011 season is not supported by the table.
434	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is refuted. The game against Atlanta on March 20th at the Philips Arena had a game attendance of 17,580, but the lowest game attendance during this period was on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center, with an attendance of 11,364.
435	According to the table you provided, the statement is correct. In game 62 against Milwaukee and game 63 against Minnesota, Greg Monroe and Charlie Villanueva tied for most rebounds with nine each. Therefore, there were two instances where there was a tie for most rebounds by Detroit Pistons players during this period of the 2010-2011 season.
436	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the US viewership for episode 2 "Finding Freebo" was 0.79 million, while the US viewership for episode 4 "All In The Family" was 0.86 million. Therefore, more viewers in the US watched episode 4 than watched episode 2 during the air date of Dexter (Season 3).
437	The statement is supported by the table. We can see from the table that Keith Gordon directed two episodes of Dexter in season 3. Row 1 lists all the episodes in season 3, and we can see that the director of each episode is listed in the column "directed by". In row 1, we see that Keith Gordon directed episode 1, "Our Father", and also directed episode 4, "All in the Family". Therefore, the statement that Keith Gordon directed two episodes of Dexter in season 3 is supported by the information in the table.
438	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "Our Father" (the first episode of Season 3) aired on September 28, 2008, and "I Had a Dream" (the final episode of Season 3) aired on December 7, 2008. Therefore, the statement that Season 3 of Dexter aired between September 28 and December 7, 2008, is supported by the information presented in the table.
439	The statement "the TV series Dexter had 11 episodes in its third season" is supported by the table. The table shows that there are 11 rows, each representing an episode of Dexter season 3. The number in the "no in season" column ranges from 1 to 11, indicating that the season had 11 episodes. So, the statement is true based on the information in the table.
440	The statement "Lauren Gussis is not an episode director for Dexter" is supported by the table. Looking at the table, the "Directed by" column shows the names of the directors for each episode in Dexter Season 3. While Lauren Gussis is credited as a writer for the episode "Easy as Pie," which aired on November 9, 2008, there is no episode where she is listed as the director. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we can conclude that the statement is true and supported by the table.
441	The statement is supported by the table. The second episode of Dexter's third season, "Finding Freebo," had 0.79 million viewers in the US, while the fourth episode, "All In The Family," had 0.86 million viewers. Thus, the fourth episode had fewer viewers in the US compared to the second episode.
442	The statement "Keith Gordon wrote two episodes of dexter in season 3" is unsupported by the table. According to the table, Keith Gordon directed two episodes of "Dexter" in season 3 - "Our Father" (episode 1) and "All in the Family" (episode 4). However, he didn't write any of the episodes. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
443	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the first episode of season 3, "Our Father," aired on September 28, 2008. The rest of the episodes in season 3 aired after October 2008, with the last episode "I Had a Dream" airing on December 7, 2008. Therefore, the statement that "season 3 of Dexter began airing after October of 2008" is true.
444	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that season 3 of the TV series Dexter had a total of 12 episodes, which are listed in rows 1 through 11 of the table. Therefore, the statement "the TV series Dexter had more than a dozen episodes in its third season" is false.
445	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the seventh episode of Dexter (season 3) titled "Easy As Pie" was written by Lauren Gussis. Therefore, the statement "Lauren Gussis was not a writer for Dexter" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
446	I apologize, but I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table, as the table only provides information about the constituencies in the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency and the number of electorates in each constituency. The table does not provide any information about the number of times election results were counted in each district or constituency.
447	The statement "mehgaon had the highest number of electorates in 2009" is not supported by the table. According to the table, the constituency with the highest number of electorates in 2009 is Lahar (Bhind Lok Sabha constituency), with 205839 electorates. Mehgaon had the fourth-highest number of electorates, with 210649 electorates, as shown in the table.
448	I can see from the table that the number of electorates in Gohad was 166893, and the number of electorates in Bhander was 139600. Therefore, the statement that "Gohad had 36732 more electorates in 2009 than Bhander" is supported by the information in the table.
449	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Sewda (constituency number 20) had the lowest number of electorates in 2009 with a total of 130161.
450	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Datia's constituency number is 22, and Gohad's constituency number is 13. The difference between these two numbers is 9, which means that Datia's constituency number is indeed higher than Gohad's by 9. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
451	We cannot determine whether the statement "the results were counted in bhind district three times and five times in datia" is supported or refuted by the table. The table provides information on the Lok Sabha constituencies in the area, including the name, reserved category (if any), district, and number of electorates for each constituency. However, the table does not provide any information related to the counting of election results or how many times the results were counted in various locations. Therefore, we cannot confirm or refute the statement based on the information provided in the table.
452	The statement "mehgaon tied with datia to have the highest number of electorates in 2009" is refuted by the information provided in the table. As per the table, the number of electorates for "mehgaon" in 2009 was 210649, while for "datia" it was 143593. This clearly shows that "mehgaon" had a higher number of electorates in 2009 as compared to "datia". Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
453	I apologize, but I noticed an error in your previous message. The correct statement should be "Gohad had 16693 more electorates in 2009 than Bhander". Now, coming to the question, the table provides the number of electorates in five different constituencies of Bhind (Lok Sabha Constituency) in 2009. From the table, we can see that Gohad had 166,893 electorates, while Bhander had 139,600 electorates. If we subtract 139,600 from 166,893, we get 27,293, which is not equal to the number mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement "Gohad had 16693 more electorates in 2009 than Bhander" is refuted by the table.
454	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Sewda had a number of electorates of 130161 in 2009. If we compare this number with other constituencies listed in the table, we will see that Sewda had the second-lowest number of electorates, with only Gohad having a lower number of electorates at 166893. Therefore, the statement that "Sewda had the second lowest number of electorates in 2009" is supported by the information presented in the table.
455	The statement that "Datia's constituency number is lower than Gohad's by 10" cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. This is because the constituency numbers in the table are not arranged in ascending order, and the difference between Datia's and Gohad's constituency numbers is not necessarily 10. However, we can see from the table that Gohad is reserved for SC, while Datia is not reserved for any category. Also, the total number of electorates for all the constituencies listed in the table is 1,371,252.
456	I'm sorry, but I cannot determine if the statement "25 - 26 january 2003 and 12 - 13 july 2003 were the only games played in 2003" is supported or refuted by the table provided. The table only shows events that "tsuyoshi fujita" participated in, but does not provide a comprehensive list of all games played in 2003. Additionally, the table only shows data for "tsuyoshi fujita," so it may not include all Magic: The Gathering events played in 2003 by other players.
457	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that there was only one event with the event type "invitational," which took place in Los Angeles in the 2005 season. Therefore, the statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2005 season in Los Angeles" is true based on the given table.
458	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 were in the standard format" is refuted. Season 2001 - 02 had two events: "limited" in Hong Kong and "team limited" in Nagoya. Season 2002 - 03 had three events: "limited" in Utsunomiya, "extended" in Hiroshima, and "standard" in Bangkok. Season 2003 - 04 had two events: "special" in Osaka (Nationals) and "standard" in Kuala Lumpur. Therefore, none of these seasons had all events in the standard format, and the statement is refuted.
459	The statement is not supported by the table. The table does not have any reference to "season 5", and the locations specified in the table do not match the locations mentioned in the statement. Therefore, it can be concluded that the statement is false or unsupported by the information given in the table.
460	The statement "there was only 1 event in 2011 and it was on 10 - 12 June 2011" is refuted by the table. The table shows that Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in several events in different locations in 2011, including the Pro Tour in Nagoya on 10-12 June 2011 but also in other events before and after that date (rows 22-23).
461	The table shows that Tsuyoshi Fujita played in multiple events in 2003, including the Grand Prix in Utsunomiya on October 12-13, 2002, and the Grand Prix in Bangkok on July 12-13, 2003. Therefore, the statement "25 - 26 january 2003 was the only game played in 2003" is refuted by the information in the table since it shows that Tsuyoshi Fujita played in other events in 2003.
462	The statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2002 season in Los Angeles" is refuted by the table. As per the table, there was an invitational event type in the year 2005, held in Los Angeles, which contradicts the statement.
463	The statement "seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04 were in the limited format" is supported by the information in the table. Rows 9, 13, 14, and 16 show events from these seasons, and all of them are listed as being in the limited format.
464	I apologize, but the given table does not provide any information about Season 5 or the last four games being held in Los Angeles and London. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the given table.
465	The statement "there were ten events in 2011" cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. The table only shows a total of 16 events that took place between 1997 and 2011. It does not provide information for every year or every event that occurred during that timeframe, and it does not provide information beyond 2011. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot confirm or deny whether there were ten events in 2011.
466	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, there are three episodes in January: "fathers and sons," "the return of the grievous angel," and "duchess of george." In February, there are only two episodes: "hit and rum" and "the one who got away." Therefore, the statement that there were three episodes that aired in January, while only two aired in February is true based on the information in the table.
467	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, there are five episodes that aired in March - episodes 7 to 11. No other month has as many as five episodes airing during that month. Therefore, the statement is true.
468	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table provided, there were two episodes in the series that were directed by Mike Clattenburg: "Fathers and Sons" (Row 2) and "Duchess of George" (Row 4). Therefore, the statement holds true based on the information provided in the table.
469	This statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. While the table provides information on the episode titles, directors, writers, viewership, original air dates, and production codes, it does not provide information about the number of episodes that each director directed. Therefore, we cannot determine from this table whether there are three different directors that directed two episodes.
470	From the table provided, we can see that Mike Clattenburg directed two episodes, which are episodes 1 and 3. On the other hand, Steve Scaini directed only one episode, which is episode 11. Therefore, the statement "Mike Clattenburg directed one more episode than Steve Scaini" is refuted by the information in the table because Mike Clattenburg directed one more episode than Steve Scaini.
471	The statement "there were three episodes that aired in February, while only two aired in January" is supported by the table. According to the table, there were only two episodes that aired in January (episodes 1 and 2) while three episodes aired in February (episodes 5, 6, and 7). Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
472	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "original airdate" column, there are a total of five episodes with January air dates, which is the most for any month listed in the table.
473	The statement "there were two episodes in the series that were directed by Perry Chafe" is incorrect according to the table provided. Based on the information in the "directed by" column of the table, none of the episodes in the series were directed by Perry Chafe. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
474	Looking at the table, we can see that there were directors who directed more than one episode. For example, Allan Hawco directed the second episode "The Return of the Grievous Angel," and also co-wrote the first and third episodes along with Perry Chafe and Malcolm MacRury, respectively. Additionally, Mike Clattenburg directed both the first and third episodes. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
475	Sorry, based on the given table, the statement "Steve Scaini directed one more episode than Mike Clattenburg" is refuted because in the table, Mike Clattenburg directed two episodes (episodes 1 and 3) while Steve Scaini directed only one episode (episode 11). Thus, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
476	The statement "Carlos Cuéllar had the highest transfer fee of any player at 7.8 m" is supported by the table as it is listed in row 11 under the "transfer fee" column as 7.8 m.
477	I apologize for the confusion, but the table you provided does not contain information about other teams, only the transfers of Rangers F.C. during the 2008-09 season. Therefore, it is impossible to say whether or not the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
478	The statement "only seven players were transferred at the end of their contract" can be supported by the table about 2008-09 Rangers F.C. season. This table shows that a total of seven players were transferred at the end of their contract, as indicated in rows 2-8.
479	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 29 of the table, Chris Burke transferred to Cardiff City for free during the winter transfer window of 2008-09. Therefore, he was the only player in the table who moved on a free transfer.
480	The statement "nineteen players were transferred during the summer window as opposed to six during the winter window" is supported by the table. From the data presented in the table, we can observe that there were 19 players either sold or loaned out during the summer transfer window (rows 2-26) compared to 6 players (rows 27-32) during the winter transfer window. Therefore, the statement can be confirmed as accurate based on the information in the table.
481	The statement "Carlos Cuéllar had the lowest transfer fee of any player at 7.8 m" is supported by the table. In row 11 of the table, under the "Transfer Fee" column, it states "7.8 m" for the transfer of Carlos Cuéllar from Rangers F.C. to Aston Villa. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information presented in the table.
482	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "sco had the lowest amount of transfers at 22" appears to be unsupported as we can only see the transfers made by Rangers F.C. during the 2008-09 season. The table lists 33 transfers made by Rangers F.C., but it doesn't give us any information about the total number of transfers made by all Scottish clubs during that season. Therefore, we cannot confirm if 22 was indeed the lowest number of transfers made by any Scottish club during that season without additional information.
483	The statement "ten of the players were transferred at the end of their contract" is supported by the information presented in the table. Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 27, and 29 all indicate that the player moved to another club at the end of their contract with Rangers F.C.
484	Supported. The table shows that Chris Burke transferred to Cardiff City with a free transfer fee, which means that he was one of the five players with a free transfer fee listed in the table.
485	The statement is partly supported by the information in the table. According to the table, there were 10 transfers during the summer window (rows 3, 9, 10, 11, 19, and 27-31) and 4 loans (rows 12-14 and 16). However, there is no information on the number of transfers during the winter window. The table only lists 3 transfers (rows 28-30) and 1 loan (row 32) during the winter window. Therefore, the statement is supported for transfers but not for loans, as there were more transfers during the summer window than the winter window. However, we cannot accurately determine the number of total transfers during the winter window as the table does not provide the complete information.
486	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Melbourne was the away team when they played against Collingwood and they scored 8.10 (58), which is the lowest score among all the away teams listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "Melbourne had the lowest score when playing as the away team" is supported by the table.
487	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the Collingwood vs Melbourne game has the largest crowd size" is supported as the crowd size for that game was 30,883. This is the largest crowd size listed in the table, and therefore, the statement is supported.
488	According to the provided table, the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was 7,007, while the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game was 22,251. Therefore, the statement "the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was smaller than the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
489	To check if the statement "the average of all the home team scores is 15.67" is supported or refuted by the table, we need to calculate the average of all the home team scores:  Average home team score = (14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13) / 6                           = 94.03 / 6                           = 15.67 (rounded to two decimal places)Therefore, the statement "the average of all the home team scores is 15.67" is supported by the information in the table.
490	Refuted - Only 2 out of 6 away teams had a score greater than 10 in the 1972 VFL season match results presented in the table. Specifically, Richmond scored 111 (17.9) against Essendon, and Geelong scored 98 (15.8) against Hawthorn, while the other 4 away teams (St Kilda, North Melbourne, South Melbourne, and Melbourne) scored less than 10 goals. Hence, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
491	The statement cannot be accurately determined from the given table. The table provides information about the scores of six matches played on July 15th, 1972, but it doesn't have details of all matches involving Melbourne as the away team. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Melbourne had the second lowest score when playing as the away team based on the information provided in the given table.
492	After checking the table, I can confirm that the statement "the Collingwood vs Melbourne game has the third largest crowd size" is supported by the information presented in the table. The attendance of the Collingwood vs Melbourne game was 30,883, which is greater than the attendance of the Footscray vs St Kilda, Fitzroy vs North Melbourne, Essendon vs Richmond, Carlton vs South Melbourne, and Hawthorn vs Geelong games, but less than the attendance of the Carlton vs Hawthorn game (with an attendance of 52,695) and the Essendon vs Carlton game (with an attendance of 36,916). Therefore, the statement that "the Collingwood vs Melbourne game has the third largest crowd size" is accurate when compared to the information presented in the table.
493	The statement "more attended the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game than the Essendon vs Richmond game" cannot be determined by the table. The table only provides information about the attendance at each game, but does not include the attendance figures for the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game and the Essendon vs Richmond game side-by-side for comparison purposes. Therefore, we cannot confirm or refute the statement based on the information in the given table.
494	To determine if the statement "the average of all the home team scores is less than 12" is supported or refuted by the table, we need to calculate the average of all the home team scores in the table:- Home team scores: 14.7, 16.14, 13.12, 20.8, 19.14, 10.13- Average of home team scores = (14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13) / 6 = 14.39The average of all the home team scores in the table is 14.39, which is greater than 12. Therefore, the statement "the average of all the home team scores is less than 12" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
495	Refuted. Only three out of the six away teams (St Kilda, North Melbourne, and Geelong) had a score greater than 10, which is less than half of the total away teams in the table. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
496	The statement "the agricultural panel and labour panel both have 11 total members" is refuted by the information in the table. From the table, we can see that the agricultural panel has 11 members while the labour panel has 5 members. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
497	The statement is supported by the table. From the table, we can see that Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, while the party with the fewest total members is Clann na Talmhan, with only 3 members. Therefore, we can calculate that Fianna Fáil has 18 more members than Clann na Talmhan - 21 (Fianna Fáil) - 3 (Clann na Talmhan) = 18. So the statement "the party with 21 total members has 18 more members than the party with the fewest total members" is supported by the information presented in the table.
498	I can see in the table that the University of Dublin panel has 0 members from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan or Independent parties. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. The University of Dublin panel is the only group that is composed entirely of members from one party - in this case, no specific political party is listed for this panel.
499	According to the table provided, the statement "nominated by the taoiseach has the most members from one party" is supported. The table shows that there are 11 members nominated by the taoiseach, and they belong to different panels. Therefore, it can be concluded that no other party has as many members as the group nominated by the taoiseach alone.
500	The statement "industrial and commercial panel has four more members than cultural and educational panel" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the industrial and commercial panel has three members, whereas the cultural and educational panel has two members. Therefore, the industrial and commercial panel has only one more member than the cultural and educational panel, not four more.
501	The statement "the agricultural panel has 2 members and the labour panel has 5 members" is supported by the table. In the table, the agricultural panel has a total of 11 members, and in the second row, we can see that Fine Gael has 3 members and Clann Na Talmhan has 2 members, totaling to 5 members of the agricultural panel. However, both of these parties have members only in the agricultural panel and not in the labor panel. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are 2 members from the agricultural panel and 5 members from the labor panel.
502	According to the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, which is 9 more than Fine Gael, the party with the second most members. Fine Gael has a total of 9 members.
503	That statement is refuted by the table. While it is true that the National University of Ireland panel has three members that were nominated by Fine Gael, there is also one member each from the Fianna Fáil, Labour Party, and independent groups. Therefore, the National University of Ireland panel is not made up mostly of members from two parties.
504	Based on the table provided, the statement "agricultural panel has the most members from one party" is not supported. While it is true that Fianna Fáil has the most members in the Agricultural panel with four, the Labour panel has the most members from one party with five members from the Labour party. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
505	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement that "administrative panel has four more members than national university of Ireland" is refuted. According to the table, the administrative panel has seven members, while the National University of Ireland panel has only one member. Therefore, the administrative panel has six more members than the National University of Ireland panel, not four.
506	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, ASC Diaraf played against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs and won the first leg 3-0. However, they lost the second leg 0-4, resulting in a total aggregate score of 3-4 in favor of Stade Malien. Therefore, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
507	The statement "the young africans scored two points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs" is not supported or refuted by the information in the given table. The table only provides information related to the results of the matches played between various teams in the tournament. It does not show the overall points or standings of the teams participating in the tournament. Therefore, to know whether the Young Africans scored two points or not, we need additional information beyond the given table.
508	The statement that "secteur 6 lost by one against the Enugu Rangers" is supported by the information in the table. In row 9 of the table, it shows that Secteur 6 played against Enugu Rangers, and the aggregate score was 1-2. Their first leg ended in a 1-1 draw, and in the second leg, Enugu Rangers won 1-0. Therefore, Secteur 6 lost by one goal to Enugu Rangers.
509	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 6 of the table, AS Porto Novo faced Victoria Club Mokanda and scored 0 points as they lost both legs with a score of 0-1 in the first leg and 0-2 in the second leg.
510	That statement cannot be directly supported or refuted by the given table since the scores of the teams in each match are shown, not the total points earned by each team. To determine whether Canon Yaoundé scored five more points than their opponent, we would need to tally up the number of points earned by each team during the tournament. The points are typically awarded for wins, draws, and losses, and often includes a bonus for goals scored. The table, as it is presented, only shows the results of the matches played by each team.
511	The statement "ASC Diaraf won against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien with a score of 3-4 in the first leg and 0-4 in the second leg. Therefore, Stade Malien won the match with an aggregate score of 3-8, and the statement is refuted.
512	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to row 10 of the table, the Young Africans team won their match against Lavori Publici with a score of 2-0 in the 1st leg and a score of 0-0 in the 2nd leg. Therefore, the Young Africans scored a total of 4 points in that round of the competition. So, the statement that the Young Africans scored zero points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs is false.
513	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Enugu Rangers won against Secteur 6 with a score of 2-1 (1-1 in the first leg, 0-1 in the second leg). Therefore, the statement that Secteur 6 won against Enugu Rangers is not supported by the information presented in the table.
514	I'm sorry, but the statement "as porto novo scored three points against the victoria club mokanda" cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table as there are no points mentioned in the table. The table only lists the aggregate score between teams, and the results of the first and second legs of the matches. It does not provide information on the number of points scored by each team. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm or deny whether As Porto Novo scored three points against Victoria Club Mokanda based on the information in the table.
515	The statement "Canon Yaounde scored zero points against their opponent" is refuted by the table. Canon Yaounde won both legs (7-3 and 2-1) and scored a total of 9 points against their opponent, AS Solidarité.
516	The statement appears to be supported by the table. Looking at the "attendance" column in the table provided, the lowest attendance is 22,616 (on September 17th against the Giants), and the highest attendance is 54,137 (on September 7th against the Dodgers). The difference between these two attendance numbers is 31,521, which matches the statement provided. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
517	This statement is supported by the table. As we can see from rows 8-16 of the table, the Arizona Diamondbacks played three games against the San Francisco Giants on September 8th, 9th, and 10th, and then another set of four games against the Giants on September 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th. Therefore, the Giants played a total of 7 games within the month of September against the Diamondbacks according to the table.
518	The statement is refuted by the table since none of the games listed in the table had a score of more than 10 points. The highest score difference in a single game is 9 points (13-4 on September 21).
519	The statement is refuted by the table as there is no mention of player Rosales having any losses during September. The table provides the names of the pitchers who were credited with losses in each game, and none of the entries list Rosales. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the statement that Rosales had three losses during September in the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season.
520	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the highest attendance recorded during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season was on September 7th when they faced the Dodgers, and the attendance was 54,137. The second-highest attendance recorded was on September 5th when they faced the Dodgers, and the attendance was 52,270. Therefore, there was only one game in which the attendance was over 50,000, not two.
521	Based on the provided table data, the statement that "the average number of people in the game is 31 521 during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season" is unsupported. We cannot get the average number of people in the game from the table as it only shows the attendance figures for each game, and we do not have information on the attendance for all the games played during the season.
522	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the giants have played more games than the cardinals for the month of September" is refuted. The table shows that the Arizona Diamondbacks played against the Cardinals on September 1, 2, and 3, and then again on September 22, 23, 24, and 25. This means that they played a total of 7 games against the Cardinals in September. In contrast, the table shows that the Diamondbacks played against the Giants on September 8, 9, and 10, and then again on September 15, 16, 17, and 18. This means that they played a total of 7 games against the Giants in September as well. Since the number of games played against the Cardinals and the Giants is the same for September, the statement is refuted.
523	This statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table because there are no games with scores higher than 10 points in the table. The highest score mentioned in the table is 13 points, which occurred in a game between the Diamondbacks and the Rockies. However, it's worth noting that the table only includes games played in September 2008, so if there were games earlier in the season with scores higher than 10 points, they wouldn't be reflected in this table.
524	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at row 24, the Arizona Diamondbacks lost to the Cardinals with Rosales being the losing pitcher (Rosales (1 - 1)) and this adds to his total losses for the season. However, if we look at row 23, Johnson was the losing pitcher for the Diamondbacks, but he already had 10 losses before that game. Therefore, Rosales has more losses than Johnson in the 2008 season.
525	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the highest attendance of the season was on September 5" is supported. The attendance on September 5 was 52,270, which is the highest attendance listed in the table.
526	Based on the table you provided, the statement "saint-louis fc game had the highest combined agg of any of the featured games" is refuted. The highest combined agg in the featured games is the CD Elá Nguema vs Primeiro de Agosto game, which has a total of 8 goals (2 - 6 in favor of Primeiro de Agosto). The Saint-Louis FC vs Young Africans game has a combined agg of 9 goals (2 - 7 in favor of Young Africans), which is higher than the CD Elá Nguema vs Primeiro de Agosto game, but it was not the highest agg of any of the featured games.
527	Refuted. The 4th game, which is "CD Elá Nguema vs. Primeiro de Agosto", ended with a 2-6 score, resulting in a total of 8 goals. On the other hand, the 6th game, which is "ASC Police vs. AS Real Bamako", ended with a 2-2 score in the regular time and went into penalties, where ASC Police lost 4-5, resulting in a total of 4 goals. Therefore, the 4th game on the list had a higher scoring compared to the 6th game.
528	Based on the table provided, the statement "there were only two games where the score was 0 - 0 for the 1st leg" is supported. As we can see from the table, there are only two rows where the "1st leg" column shows a score of "0 - 0". These are row 7 (Port Autonome vs. Sporting Clube da Praia) and row 11 (Tourbillon FC vs. Forces Armées CA). Therefore, the statement is true.
529	The statement is supported by the table. Botswana Defence Force XI had an aggregate score of 1-2 in their two matches against Mbabane Highlanders, while Arsenal (Maseru) had an aggregate score of 4-0 in their two matches against Eleven Arrows FC. Therefore, Botswana Defence Force XI had a lower aggregate score than Arsenal (Maseru).
530	The statement is true based on the information presented in the table. The 1st leg score for Botswana Defence Force XI and ASC Police matches are the same, with both teams scoring 1-1 in the 1st leg. Therefore, the statement "the Botswana Defence Force XI and the ASC Police games have the same 1st leg score" is supported by the information in the table.
531	I apologize, but that statement is incorrect. The highest combined agg in the table is actually between  CD Elá Nguema and Primeiro de Agosto with a total of 2-6 (2-3, 0-3) in the first round. The game between Saint-Louis FC and Eleven Arrows FC had a combined agg of only 1-1 (1-0, 0-1). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
532	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is refuted. The score of the match between LPRC Oilers and Mighty Blackpool was higher (2-3) compared to the match between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia (0-0 with 1-3 penalty shootout). Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
533	The statement "a total of two games and two legs that has the score of 0 - 0" is partially supported by the table. Based on the information presented in the table, there is one game that ended with a score of 0-0 for both legs. The game is between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia in row 7. However, since there is only one game that matches this criterion, it cannot be said that "a total of two games" had a score of 0-0. Therefore, the statement is only partially supported by the table.
534	Refuted. While Botswana Defense Force XI did have a low aggregate score, it's not the lowest in the season according to the table. From the table, we can see that CD Elá Nguema has the lowest aggregate of 2-6 after losing 2-3 at home and 0-3 away to Primeiro de Agosto. Therefore, the statement "Botswana Defence Force XI has the lowest agg in the season" is not supported by the information in the table.
535	The statement cannot be determined solely by looking at the provided table as there is not enough information to confirm or refute the statement. While some rows in the table show the scores during the 1st and 2nd leg, there is no indication of how many teams have the same score during the 1st leg. Therefore, additional information would be needed to confirm or refute the statement.
536	The statement "lukáš melich competed in the Olympic games two times" is supported by the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 and in London in 2012.
537	The statement "lukáš melich placed third place or higher in one competition" is supported by the table. According to row 11 in the table, Lukáš Melich placed third in the world championships in Moscow in 2013. This means that he placed third place or higher in one competition.
538	The statement "the competition type was a junior championship two times" is supported by the table. Lukáš Melich competed in the world junior championships in 1998 and the European junior championships in 1999, both of which were junior championships.
539	Sorry, I have reviewed the table, and I cannot support or refute the statement that "four of the competitions out of ten were world-wide championships." The table only provides information such as the year, competition name, venue, position, and notes of Lukáš Melich's performances. It does not provide information about the type of championship or the countries that participated in the competition.Therefore, I cannot confirm or refute the statement based on the information presented in the table.
540	The table provided does not include information about the distance Lukáš Melich threw in each competition. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the statement "in Lukáš Melich's last two competitions he threw an average distance of 78.27 m" is supported or refuted by the table.
541	Based on the table provided, the statement "lukáš melich won a medal at the Olympic Games" is refuted. The table shows that Melich participated in the Olympics twice (in 2008 and 2012) but did not win a medal in either of these two events. His best performance came in the 2013 World Championships where he won a bronze medal in javelin throw.
542	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "lukáš melich's best finish was second" is refuted. The table lists Lukáš Melich's performances in various competitions over the years, including his position and notes. His best finishes listed in the table are 3rd place at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow and 5th place at the 1999 European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia. Therefore, the statement that his best finish was second is not supported by the information in the table.
543	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's highest finish was actually as a senior athlete. In 2013, he finished in 3rd place at the World Championships in Moscow, Russia with a distance of 79.36 m. As per the data in the table, in his junior career, his best finish was at the European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia in 1999, where he finished in 5th position with a distance of 64.20 m.
544	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "four of the competitions were senior world championships" is refuted. The table shows that Lukáš Melich participated in three world championships: in 2005 (14th), 2009 (14th), and 2013 (3rd). However, only three of the competitions in the table were world championships, while the other competitions were junior championships, U23 championships, Universiade, European championships, and Olympic games. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
545	The statement "lukáš melich never threw for greater than 78 m" is refuted by the table presented. According to the table, Lukáš Melich achieved a distance of 79.36 m in the 2013 world championships, which is greater than 78 m. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
546	This statement is supported by the table. Only two teams, Hawthorn and South Melbourne, scored less than 10 goals in the games played on June 18, 1938. The table shows that Hawthorn scored 6.13 (49) and South Melbourne scored 8.8 (56), while all other teams scored more than 10 goals each. Therefore, the statement is correct.
547	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. While it is true that all the home teams listed in the table scored 11 or more points, the table only includes data from one round of matches in the 1938 VFL season. To make a conclusive statement about all home teams in the entire 1938 season, data from multiple rounds would need to be analyzed.
548	The statement is supported by the table. Carlton scored the highest number of points in their match against North Melbourne with a score of 16.25 (121), while no other team scored more than 112 points, which was Melbourne's score in their match against St. Kilda.
549	The statement is true. The table shows that the game between Richmond and Essendon, played on June 18, 1938, at Punt Road Oval, drew a crowd of 20,000. However, all the other games played on the same day had a crowd of less than 20,000, as shown in the table. Therefore, the statement that "no game on the 18th of June drew a crowd of more than 20,000" is supported by the information presented in the table.
550	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Three home teams, Geelong, Fitzroy, and St Kilda, had higher scores than their respective away teams, Hawthorn, South Melbourne, and Melbourne. Specifically, Geelong won with a score of 11.23 (89) against Hawthorn's 6.13 (49), Fitzroy won with a score of 16.12 (108) against South Melbourne's 8.8 (56), and St Kilda scored 14.12 (96) against Melbourne's 16.16 (112). Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
551	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "only two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored more than 10" is refuted.The table shows that four teams scored more than 10 points in the matches played on June 18, 1938. Geelong scored 11.23 (89), Fitzroy scored 16.12 (108), St Kilda scored 14.12 (96), and Richmond scored 15.14 (104). So, the statement is not accurate as per the information provided in the table.
552	The statement is refuted by the table provided. The home team Geelong scored 11 goals and 23 behinds, which translates to a total of 89 points. While no other home team scored more than 11 goals, some scored more than 11 points due to the addition of behinds. Therefore, the statement that no home team scored more than 11 is incorrect, as at least one home team scored 89 points.
553	The statement "the second-highest scoring team for the games that happened on the 18th of June was by Carlton" is supported by the table. Looking at the table, Carlton played against North Melbourne, and the away team scored 121 points, which is the second-highest score recorded in the table, after Melbourne's 112 points in their game against St Kilda. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data presented in the table.
554	The statement is refuted by the table. Only one game on the 18th of June 1938 had a crowd of more than 20000 and that game was played at Punt Road Oval between Richmond and Essendon. The crowd at that match was 20000, so the other matches played on the same date drew crowds of fewer than 20000.
555	The statement "two home teams had the same scores as the away teams that they were playing" is not supported by the information in the table. We can see that in row 1, Geelong scored 11.23 (89) while Hawthorn scored 6.13 (49); and in row 7, North Melbourne scored 11.5 (71) while Carlton scored 16.25 (121). Therefore, none of the home teams had the same score as their respective away teams.
556	The statement "alberto pagani has only won with two teams: linto and mv agusta" is supported by the table. Alberto Pagani has won 2 races with the Linto team and 2 races with the MV Agusta team, as indicated by the entries in rows 22, 27, 28, and 30 of the table. While he has raced for several other teams, he has not won any races with them.
557	The statement you provided can be refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Alberto Pagani won races in two different classes, specifically:- In 1969, Pagani won one race in the 500cc class while riding for team Linto.- In 1971, Pagani won one race in the 500cc class while riding for teams Linto and MV Agusta.Therefore, the statement that "all of Alberto Pagani's wins is of the 500cc class" is not supported by the table.
558	The statement "1971 was the only year Alberto Pagani won two times in the same year" cannot be verified or refuted by the table provided. The table shows Pagani's race results in different years and categories, but it doesn't provide information on whether he won multiple races in the same year. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table alone.
559	I'm sorry, but we cannot support or refute the given statement solely based on the provided table as it doesn't provide sufficient data to calculate the average points Alberto Pagani scored per race he won. The table describes the year, class, team, points scored, and wins, for each of the races Alberto Pagani participated in, but it doesn't provide details of the points scored in each race he won. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the average points scored per race won.
560	Based on the table provided, the statement "Alberto Pagani has raced for Aermacchi ten times, more than any other team" is supported. According to the table, Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi a total of ten times between 1960 and 1970, which is more than any other team listed in the table.
561	The statement that "Alberto Pagani has only won with two teams: Linto and MV Agusta, all before 1967" is refuted by the table. Alberto Pagani won with a total of five different teams, including Ducati, Aermacchi, Honda, Paton, and Derbi. He did win with Linto and MV Agusta, but not exclusively before 1967. He won with Linto in 1969 and MV Agusta in 1971 and 1972.
562	The statement is partially false. The table shows that Alberto Pagani has only won one race in the 500cc class, in 1969 with the Linto team, with a total of 15 points that season. Therefore, not all of his wins were in the 500cc class. Additionally, his average points in the 500cc class based on the table data is 29, not 87. So the statement is refuted by the table.
563	Unfortunately, the statement you provided is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Alberto Pagani did not win any races in the 250cc class in 1971 or any other year. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have won two times in the same year in that class. It's important to note that while Alberto Pagani did win races in other classes and years, the particular statement you provided does not hold up against the information in the table.
564	I'm sorry, but the statement "Alberto Pagani averages 40 points in races he wins in the 250cc class" cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the given table. The table only provides information about the class, team, points, and wins for each year and race category Pagani participated in, but it doesn't specify which races he won or how many points he earned in each race. Without this information, it's impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.
565	Based on the table provided, the statement is refuted. Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi six times, not ten, according to the table. Additionally, he did not win any of those races as all the corresponding entries in the "Wins" column are zero.
566	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, during the 1993 new york jets season, the New York Jets played 8 games at the game site named "The Meadowlands" (rows 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 16).
567	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided does not make sense. Did you mean to say "six games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 new york jets season"? If so, then the statement is true. According to the table, there were six games during the 1993 New York Jets season that had an attendance of over 70,000. These games were:- Week 2: Jets vs. Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium - attendance of 70,314- Week 5: Jets vs. Eagles at The Meadowlands - attendance of 72,593- Week 7: Jets vs. Bills at The Meadowlands - attendance of 71,541- Week 8: Jets vs. Giants at Giants Stadium - attendance of 71,659- Week 9: Jets vs. Dolphins at The Meadowlands - attendance of 71,306- Week 16: Jets vs. Cowboys at The Meadowlands - attendance of 73,233Therefore, the statement "six games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 new york jets season" is supported by the information presented in the table.
568	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement that "the New York Jets took the same amount of wins as losses during the 1993 season" is supported. The Jets had a total of 8 wins and 8 losses during that season.
569	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the New York Jets played their first game of the season against the Denver Broncos in week 1, which took place on September 5, 1993. The Jets' second game was against the Miami Dolphins, which took place in week 2 on September 12, 1993. Therefore, the statement that "the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos before the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season" is true and is supported by the table.
570	Unfortunately, the statement cannot be supported or refuted based on the table provided. The table only provides information about the dates, opponents, scores, game sites, and attendance of each game played by the New York Jets during the 1993 season. It does not provide any information about the attendance of their first game against the Miami Dolphins, so we cannot compare it to the attendance of their second game against them. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the information available in the table.
571	The statement you provided is incorrect, as the table shows that the New York Jets did not play any games at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium during the 1993 season. The table shows that the New York Jets played their home games at two different locations: The Meadowlands and Giants Stadium. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
572	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the attendance column, only three games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season: 1. Week 2 against Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium with an attendance of 70,314.2. Week 7 against Buffalo Bills at the Meadowlands with an attendance of 71,541.3. Week 16 against Dallas Cowboys at the Meadowlands with an attendance of 73,233.Therefore, the statement that eight games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season is false or refuted.
573	Based on the information in the table given, the statement that "the New York Jets took three more wins over losses during the 1993 season" is supported. The Jets had a total of 8 wins and 8 losses during the 1993 season. They won their games against the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots (twice), NY Giants, Indianapolis Colts (twice), Cincinnati Bengals, and the Washington Redskins. They lost their games against the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Raiders, Buffalo Bills (twice), Indianapolis Colts (once), Dallas Cowboys, and Houston Oilers. Therefore, since the Jets won 8 games and lost 8 games, their wins and losses are equal, not exceeding or reducing by three games.
574	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. The first game listed in the table is the Week 1 matchup between the New York Jets and the Denver Broncos, while the second game listed is the Week 2 matchup between the Jets and the Miami Dolphins. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Jets played the Denver Broncos before the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season.
575	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not support or refute the statement that "the New York Jets had 992 more people in attendance in their second game against the New England Patriots than from their first game played against them during the 1993 season." The table only provides information about the date, opponent, result, game site, and attendance for each game played by the New York Jets in the 1993 season, but it does not compare attendance figures between games against the same opponent.
576	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Brian Sipe started 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started 105 games, which means that Brian Sipe started seven more games than Bernie Kosar.
577	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The quarterbacks Frank Ryan, Jim Ninowski, and George Ratterman all have two different uniform numbers listed next to their names. Frank Ryan is listed as wearing both 13 and 12, Jim Ninowski is listed as wearing both 15 and 11, and George Ratterman is listed as wearing both 12 and 16. Therefore, there are indeed three starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns who have two different uniform numbers listed in the table.
578	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of ten games" is refuted. The table shows that the Browns have only tied a total of 4 games, with Bernie Kosar being the only starting quarterback to have tied a game with the Browns.
579	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement that "only ten Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 10 games" is refuted. According to the table, there are 20 quarterbacks who have won 10 or more games as a starter for the Cleveland Browns. These 20 quarterbacks are Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar, Frank Ryan, Otto Graham, Tim Couch, Bill Nelsen, Mike Phipps, Milt Plum, Derek Anderson, Vinny Testaverde, Paul McDonald, Colt McCoy, Charlie Frye, Brandon Weeden, Tommy O'Connell, Kelly Holcomb, Jim Ninowski, Trent Dilfer, Jeff Garcia, and Gary Danielson. Therefore, the statement that only ten Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 10 games is not true.
580	The statement "otto graham has won 44 more games than he lost" is supported by the information provided in the table. According to the table, Otto Graham started a total of 71 games with the Cleveland Browns and won 57 of them. He lost 13 games and tied in one game, resulting in a winning percentage of 810.0. Therefore, he did win 44 more games than he lost.
581	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Brian Sipe started 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started only 105 games. This means that Brian Sipe started eight more games than Bernie Kosar.
582	Upon examining the table, I can confirm that the statement "four of the Cleveland Browns' starting quarterbacks have two different uniform numbers" is supported by the data in the table. The quarterbacks with two different uniform numbers are Otto Graham (60 and 14), Jim Ninowski (15 and 11), George Ratterman (12 and 16), and Babe Parilli (18).
583	I apologize for the confusion, but after checking the table provided, I couldn't find any information that directly supports or refutes the statement "the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of twelve games." The table only provides information on the starting quarterbacks, their uniform numbers, games started, wins, losses, ties, and winning percentage.However, based on the information in the table, we can see that there is a row for "ties," and some quarterbacks have tied games during their time as the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. But we cannot determine how many total ties the Cleveland Browns have had over their history based on this table alone. I hope that helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
584	The statement seems to be supported by the table. According to the table, there are only ten Cleveland Browns quarterbacks (Sipe, Kosar, Ryan, Graham, Nelsen, Phipps, Plum, Anderson, Testaverde, and Couch) who have won more than 30 games as a starter. The remaining 38 quarterbacks listed in the table have won fewer than 30 games as starters for the Cleveland Browns.
585	The statement is supported by the table. Otto Graham won 57 games as starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns while Brady Quinn won 3 games. Therefore, Otto Graham won 44 more games than Brady Quinn.
586	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As you can see in the "score" column, the best score achieved by any player was an even par (represented by "E") by Vicente Fernández of Argentina and Nick Job of England. No player was able to finish the tournament with an under-par score, meaning the statement is true.
587	The statement is supported by the table. We can see that there are eight players listed in row 10 to row 17 with a score of 72 (+2), and all of them are tied for the 9th place. Therefore, the statement "in the 1981 open championship there were eight players that tied for 9th" is supported by the table.
588	The statement "England and the United States had the same number of players in the 1981 Open Championship with five each" is not supported by the table. The table shows that England had eight players in the tournament (Nick Job, Tony Jacklin, Hal Sutton (a), Howard Clark, David Jagger, Mark James, Arnold Palmer (a), and Sam Torrance), whereas the United States had four players in the tournament (Johnny Miller, Hal Sutton (a), Ben Crenshaw, and Arnold Palmer (a)). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
589	The statement is not supported by the table. The winning score at the 1981 Open Championship was not 72, as no player achieved that score. The top two players tied for the lead with a score of 70 (Vicente Fernández from Argentina and Nick Job from England), which was two strokes better than the score described in the statement.
590	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. While there were ties for several positions, not every position had a tie. For example, Vicente Fernández and Nick Job tied for first place with a score of even par (E), but there were no players who tied for 2nd place. Isao Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, Hal Sutton (a), all tied for 3rd place with a score of +1, but the players who finished 9th and tied with a score of +2 were Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, and Sam Torrance. Therefore, the statement that there was a tie at every position in the 1981 Open Championship is refuted by the table.
591	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. Isao Aoki was not the only player to finish under par in the 1981 Open Championship. In fact, no player finished under par in the tournament. The table shows that all players listed had scores of even par or higher, with the lowest score being 70 (by Vicente Fernández and Nick Job). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table as no player finished under par in the 1981 Open Championship.
592	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that there were indeed eight players who tied for 9th place, and two players who tied for 3rd place. Specifically, the eight players who tied for 9th had a score of 72, +2 to par, and their names and countries are listed in rows 10-17 of the table. And the two players who tied for 3rd had a score of 71, +1 to par, and their names and countries are listed in rows 4-8 of the table. Therefore, the statement is correct.
593	The statement "England, Australia, and the United States had the same number of players in the 1981 Open Championship with five each" is **supported** by the information in the table. Out of the 33 players listed in the table, 5 players are from England, 5 players are from Australia, and 5 players are from the United States. Therefore, each of these countries had the same number of players in the 1981 Open Championship.
594	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The winning score was actually 70, not 72. Vicente Fernández (Argentina) and Nick Job (England) tied for first place with a score of 70. Isao Aoki (Japan) and David Graham (Australia) tied for third place, each with a score of 71. Therefore, the statement that the winning score was 72, with two players tying for this score, is not supported by the table.
595	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. While Vicente Fernández from Argentina did finish in a tie for first place, he was not alone in that position. In fact, he was tied with Nick Job from England, both of whom finished with a score of 70 (even par) for the tournament. Therefore, it can be concluded that the statement "in the 1981 open championship no one player achieved their position alone, except Argentina" is not supported by the information in the table.
596	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played against the San Diego Padres on four different occasions in the 2005 season, with games on September 1, September 2, September 3, and September 4.
597	Based on the given table, the statement "the reds in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season played them after the padres" is true. According to the table, the Brewers played a series against the Padres on September 1, September 2, September 3, and September 4, followed by a series against the Reds on September 5, September 6, and September 7.
598	This statement is false. Based on the information provided in the table, there is only one game in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season where one team scored no points, and that was on September 25th against the St. Louis Cardinals. In all the other games listed in the table, both teams scored points.
599	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table because it only lists the dates and opponents of the Milwaukee Brewers games in September 2005 and not their exact schedule. Therefore, we cannot determine if the Brewers played the Cardinals one day before the Reds based on the information presented in the table.
600	Based on the provided table, the statement "8 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season were attended by more than 30000 people" is refuted. Only three games had more than 30,000 attendance: the game against the Astros on September 16 with 33,767 attendees, the game against the Astros on September 17 with 37,756 attendees, and the game against the Cardinals on September 24 with 33,506 attendees.
601	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the Cubs were the opponent of the Milwaukee Brewers on September 20, September 21, September 22, and September 28, 2005, which accounts for four times during the season.
602	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played the Padres on September 1, 2, 3, and 4. After that, they played the Reds on September 5, 6, and 7. Then, they played the Astros on September 9, 10, and 11.
603	The statement is refuted by the table as there is no row in the table where one of the teams scored 0 points. In fact, the lowest score in any game in the table is 0 - 2 in row 23, where the Milwaukee Brewers scored 0 points against the St. Louis Cardinals.
604	The given table does not provide any information related to games played against the Yankees during the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table.
605	The statement is refuted by the table. The highest attendance in the table is 37756, which is for the September 17th game against the Astros. Only one game had an attendance above 30000, so it's not true that every game in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season was attended by more than 30000 people.
606	The statement "Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did" is supported by the table. According to the table, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists in three of the seven games listed (games 4, 5, and 7), while Deron Williams only led the team in assists in two of the seven games (games 1 and 2). Therefore, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did.
607	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds in three different games: - Game 77 against Minnesota on April 5th, 2011, where he scored 30 points and had 12 rebounds.- Game 78 against Detroit on April 6th, 2011, where he scored 39 points and had 7 rebounds.- Game 81 against Charlotte on April 11th, 2011, where he scored 31 points and had 8 rebounds.Therefore, the statement is true.
608	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 4 of the table, the Nets won against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Prudential Center with a score of 107-105. This is the only entry in the "score" column that indicates a win for the Nets during the 2010-11 regular season. The other six games, as seen in rows 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, all resulted in losses for the Nets, which confirms that their only win was indeed achieved at the Prudential Center.
609	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Brook Lopez was the leading scorer for the New Jersey Nets in five consecutive games. In game 77 against Minnesota, Lopez scored 30 points, and in the following game, against Detroit on April 6, he scored a season-high 39 points. In the next three games against New York, Toronto, and Charlotte, Lopez scored 27, 35, and 31 points respectively, leading the team in scoring. Therefore, the statement "brook lopez led the team in points for 5 straight games" is supported by the table.
610	The statement "the most highly attended game was against Miami at the Prudential center" is refuted by the table as the attendance for the game against Miami was 18,711, while the attendance for the game against New York on April 8 was 18,023. Therefore, the game against New York had a higher attendance than the game against Miami, making the statement false.
611	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Deron Williams led the team in assists for three out of the seven games listed (April 1 vs Philadelphia, April 3 vs Miami, and April 6 vs Detroit). In contrast, Brook Lopez is only listed as having led the team in assists in one game (April 11 vs Charlotte). Therefore, the statement that "Brook Lopez led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did" is not supported by the information in the table.
612	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table as it only provides information about the high points, high rebounds, and high assists of each game, but does not specify which player achieved them. Therefore, there is no way to determine if Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times based on this table.
613	The statement "the nets' only win came at the air canada centre" is not supported by the table. As per the table, the New Jersey Nets won one game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on April 5, 2011, at the Prudential Center. Therefore, the Nets had a win at a venue other than the Air Canada Centre.
614	The statement "Jordan Farmar led the team in points for 5 straight games" is refuted by the information presented in the table. Looking at each row of the table, while Jordan Farmar is mentioned as leading the team in assists in multiple games, he did not lead the team in points in any of the specified games. Instead, Brook Lopez was the leading scorer in four of the games mentioned and Deron Williams was the leading scorer in one game.
615	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the most highly attended game was against Minnesota at the Prudential Center" is refuted. The game against New York at the Prudential Center had the highest attendance, with a total of 18,023 people present. The game against Minnesota had a lower attendance of 13,461 people in attendance.
616	The statement "Mark Brooks is the player who earned the most money" is supported by the table. According to the table, Mark Brooks finished in first place and earned a total of $430,000, which is more than any other player listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
617	The statement is supported by the table. Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tied for first place with a score of 277 and a to-par score of -11, which is the lowest to-par score in the tournament.
618	The statement "nick price is the only player from Zimbabwe" is unsupported by the information presented in the table. The table only provides information regarding the top players of the 1996 PGA Championship, and it includes only one player from Zimbabwe, which is Nick Price. However, it does not provide information on whether or not he was the only player from Zimbabwe in the tournament.
619	The statement "Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, Frank Nobilo is the only player listed as representing New Zealand in the 1996 PGA Championship. None of the other players are from New Zealand. Therefore, the statement that "Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand" is accurate based on the information in the table.
620	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Mark Brooks won 430,000 dollars for his first-place finish at the 1996 PGA Championship, while Kenny Perry won 260,000 dollars for his second-place finish. Therefore, Kenny Perry earned 170,000 dollars less than Mark Brooks.
621	The statement "Kenny Perry is the player who earned the most money" is refuted by the table. Although Kenny Perry finished in second place, earning a score of -11, he earned $260,000 for the tournament. Mark Brooks, who finished in first place with the same -11 score, earned $430,000, making him the player who earned the most money.
622	The statement is supported by the table. Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both had a to par score of -11, which was the lowest score among all the players. They achieved this score by shooting 68 + 70 + 69 + 70 and 66 + 72 + 71 + 68, respectively.
623	This statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there were multiple players from the United States who participated in the 1996 PGA Championship, including Mark Brooks (who won the tournament), Kenny Perry, Tommy Tolles, Justin Leonard, Lee Janzen, Phil Mickelson, and Larry Mize. Therefore, Phil Mickelson was not the only American player in the championship.
624	Based on the information in the table about the 1996 PGA Championship, the statement "Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe" is refuted. Nick Price, who finished in a tie for 8th place with a score of -8, is also listed as being from Zimbabwe. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
625	The statement "Kenny Perry earned 170000 more than Mark Brooks" is refuted by the table. As per the table, Mark Brooks won the tournament and earned $430,000, while Kenny Perry finished second and earned $260,000. Therefore, the statement that Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks is not supported by the information presented in the table.
626	The statement "the zakspeed 891 chassis has a Yamaha v8 engine" is supported by the table. In row 6, it shows that the 1989 zakspeed model is the 891 with a Yamaha v8 engine. Therefore, the table confirms that statement.
627	Based on the table provided, the statement "the zakspeed 841 chassis was from the year 1985" is supported by the first row of the table which indicates that the year 1985 had the zakspeed 841 chassis. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
628	Based on the information in the provided table, the statement "there were two Zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987" is supported by the table. Row 4 of the table provides information for the year 1987 and shows that two chassis were used during that season: the Zakspeed 861 and the Zakspeed 871. Therefore, the data in the table confirms that there were indeed two Zakspeed chassis made in 1987.
629	The statement is supported by the table. In row 3, it states that the chassis used by Zakspeed was the Zakspeed 861, and it was used in the years 1986 and 1987. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
630	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the zakspeed s4 t / c engine was used on all chassis from 1985 until 1988" is supported. The table shows that the zakspeed s4 t/c engine was used on all chassis from 1985 to 1988, as it is listed as the engine for each of the cars in those years. The 1985 and 1986 chassis used the zakspeed 841 and 861 respectively, while the 1987 chassis used both the 861 and the 871, but all of them used the zakspeed s4 t/c engine. The engine was no longer used in 1989, as the table shows that the zakspeed 891 car used a Yamaha V8 engine instead.
631	The statement "the zakspeed 891 chassis has multiple Yamaha V8 engines" is supported by the table. According to the table, the 1989 zakspeed car (chassis 891) was powered by a Yamaha V8 engine. However, it is not clear from the table whether the car had multiple engines.
632	The statement "the zakspeed 841 chassis was the only chassis from the year 1985" is not supported by the table. The table shows that in addition to the Zakspeed 841 chassis, there were also different chassis used in the years that follow. The table shows that in 1986, the team used the Zakspeed 861 chassis, and in 1987, both the 861 and 871 chassis were used. In 1988, the team used the Zakspeed 881 chassis, and in 1989, they used the Zakspeed 891 chassis. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
633	Based on the presented table, the statement "there were more than two zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987" is refuted. According to the table, in 1987, only two zakspeed chassis were made - the zakspeed 861 and the zakspeed 871. Therefore, there were not more than two zakspeed chassis made in 1987.
634	The statement "the zakspeed 861 chassis was made in the years 1986 and 1987" is supported by the table. As per the table, the chassis for the 1986 and 1987 seasons is listed as zakspeed 861.
635	The supported statement is "two of the teams hold the first two positions with an equal number of points." Flamengo and Fluminense are tied with 13 points each and occupy the first and second positions in the table.
636	The statement is supported by the table. Both Flamengo and Fluminense have 13 points each, but Flamengo has a goal difference of 8, while Fluminense has a goal difference of 10. So, they have the same number of points, but they are separated by the goal difference.
637	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. As we can see from the table, there are four teams with a negative goal difference (the difference column is negative): - Portuguesa (-10)- América (-10)- São Paulo (-13)- Vasco da Gama (-2)On the other hand, there are only four teams that have scored more goals than those against them (the difference column is positive): - Flamengo (+8)- Fluminense (+5)- Corinthians (+4)- Palestra Itália (+3)Therefore, we can see that the statement is supported by the data in the table.
638	The statement "two of the teams have the same number of goals scored against them" is not supported by the table. Looking at the "against" column of the table, there are no two teams that have the same value. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
639	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Flamengo and Fluminense both have scored 13 points, whereas Corinthians have scored 9 points. However, Flamengo holds the first position due to their goal difference of +8, while Fluminense secures the second position with a goal difference of +5. This means that both teams have a tie on points but are separated by goal difference. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
640	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense had 13 points each, which means they were tied in the first position. Thus, there was no difference in the number of points between the first two teams, and the second team did not fall behind by 2 points.
641	The statement is partially supported by the table. According to the table, Flamengo is in the first position with 13 points, while Fluminense is in the second position with 13 points as well. However, the goal difference between the two teams is not two, as Fluminense has a goal difference of +5 (15 goals against, 10 in favor) and Flamengo has a goal difference of +8 (12 goals against, 20 in favor). The statement is supported in terms of the first team having more points than the second team, but it's refuted in terms of the goal difference being two.
642	Based on the table, the statement is refuted. Only one team holds a positive goal difference (Flamengo), while three teams have a negative goal difference (Portuguesa, Vasco da Gama, and América). Additionally, only one team (Fluminense) has conceded fewer goals than they have scored, while four teams have conceded more goals than they have scored (Corinthians, Palestra Itália, Portuguesa, and América). Therefore, the statement "less than 3 teams hold a minus goal difference, while more than 5 have scored more goals against them" is refuted by the information presented in the table for the 1940 Brazilian football season.
643	I'm sorry, but the table you provided doesn't include information about the number of goals each team had scored against them. The table only includes information about their points, games played, and goal difference. Therefore, I cannot support or refute the statement based on the given table.
644	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that no teams tied on points, as Flamengo and Fluminense both finished with 13 points, but Flamengo had a better goal difference (+8) compared to Fluminense (+5). However, not all teams were separated by more than one goal difference. For example, Corinthians had 9 points and a goal difference of +4, while Palestra Itália had 8 points and a goal difference of +3, which is a difference of only 1 goal. Similarly, Vasco da Gama had 6 points and a goal difference of -2, while América had 6 points and a goal difference of -10, which again is a difference of only 8 goals. Therefore, the statement is partly true but not entirely accurate in light of the table provided.
645	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Collingwood played against South Melbourne on August 14th, 1954, at Victoria Park and had a home team score of 12.16 (88). In contrast, Geelong played against Hawthorn on the same day at Kardinia Park and had a home team score of 13.12 (90). Therefore, Geelong had a higher home team score than Collingwood during the 1954 VFL season.
646	The statement "Melbourne is the team with the highest away team score" is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Melbourne scored 15.4 (94) in their away game against Richmond at Punt Road Oval on 14 August 1954. This is the highest score achieved by any away team in the matches listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
647	The statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at Arden Street Oval" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the game between North Melbourne and Footscray, which was played at Arden Street Oval, ended in a draw, with both teams scoring 9.14 (68) each. Therefore, the home team score (North Melbourne) equals the away team score (Footscray) at the game taking place at Arden Street Oval.
648	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) and Carlton's home team score was 10.16 (76). The difference between their scores is 12 - not 2. Therefore, the statement "Collingwood had a home team score 2.00 points higher than that of Carlton" is not supported by the information in the table.
649	Supported. The table shows the home team score and away team score for each match in the 1954 VFL season, along with the venue. According to the table, Kardinia Park was the venue for the Geelong vs Hawthorn match, where the home team Geelong scored 13.12 (90) and the away team Hawthorn scored 7.6 (48). As the home team score (90) is higher than the away team score (48) in this match at Kardinia Park, it can be determined that the statement is supported by the table.
650	The statement "collingwood had a home team score that was three times higher than that of geelong" is refuted by the information presented in the table for the 1954 VFL season. In fact, the home team score for Geelong was 13.12 (90) and the home team score for Collingwood was 12.16 (88), which means that Collingwood had only a slightly lower score than Geelong. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
651	The statement "Fitzroy is the team with the highest away team score" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The highest away team score is 94, achieved by Melbourne in their match against Richmond at Punt Road Oval, which is higher than Fitzroy's away team score of 69 against St. Kilda at Junction Oval. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the data presented in the table.
652	According to the table provided, the home team (St Kilda) scored 13.14 (92) and the away team (Fitzroy) scored 9.15 (69) at the game played at Junction Oval. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table since the home team score does not equal the away team score at the game played at Junction Oval.
653	The statement is refuted by the table. The home team score for Collingwood in the 1954 VFL season was 12.16 (88), while the home team score for Carlton was 10.16 (76). Therefore, Collingwood's home team score was 1.84 points higher than that of Carlton, not 3.00 points higher.
654	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that Geelong played against Hawthorn at Kardinia Park on August 14, 1954, and the home team (Geelong) scored 13.12 (90) while the away team (Hawthorn) scored 7.6 (48). Therefore, the home team's score was higher than the away team's score at Kardinia Park, which confirms the statement that Kardinia Park was one of three venues where the home team's score was higher than the away team's score during the 1954 VFL season.
655	The statement is supported by the table as shown in row 2 and 3 where the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 is approximately 0.2133 dr.
656	The statement "the relative value for both 厘 and 分 is 1 / 1600" is supported by the table. According to the table, both 厘 and 分 have a relative value of "1 / 1600" in relation to other Chinese units of measurement.
657	The statement is supported by the table. Row 6 shows that 斤 has a relative value of 1, while row 7 shows that 担 / 擔 has a relative value of 100, which means it is equal to 100 斤. Since 斤 is the base unit for weight measurement and is used to define all the other units in the table, it follows that 斤 and 担 / 擔 both have a relative value that's at least 1.
658	That statement is supported by the table. The metric value listed for 担 / 擔 in the table is 60.478982 kg, which is the only metric value measured in kg among all the characters listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is correct.
659	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The table shows that 錢 (cin4), 兩 (loeng2), and 斤 (gan1) all have metric values that are measured in grams. Specifically, 錢 is equal to 3.779936375 g, 兩 is equal to 37.79936375 g, and 斤 is equal to 604.78982 g.
660	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the imperial value for 厘 (厘 = liz) is _approximately_ 0.2133 dr (drachm), while the imperial value for 分 (分 = condorim) is also _approximately_ 0.2133 dr. Therefore, the imperial values for these two units are not equal, even though they share the same relative value of 1/1600.
661	Based on the table you provided, the statement is refuted. Looking at rows 2 and 3 of the table, we can see that both the units 厘 and 分 have the same relative value of 1/1600.
662	The statement "斤 and 担 / 擔 both have the same relative value" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, 斤 has a relative value of 1, while 担 / 擔 has a relative value of 100. Therefore, they do not have the same relative value.
663	The statement is supported by the table. The metric value for 担 / 擔 is shown in the table as 60.478982 kg, which confirms that it has a metric value measured in kg.
664	The statement "錢 and 斤 are the only characters that have metric values measured in g" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the metric value for 錢 is 3.779936375 g, and the metric value for 斤 is 604.78982 g. None of the other characters listed in the table have metric values that are measured in grams. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
665	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Manchester United held the 2nd position in the league after their match against Charlton Athletic on November 19, 2005, and maintained that position throughout the rest of the season, as shown in the league position column for every match after that date. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has been 2nd in league position since 17 November 2005" is true based on the information in the table.
666	According to the table, Manchester United has played against Portsmouth only once since August 13, 2005, and they have won that match with a scoreline of 3-0 on December 3, 2005, at Old Trafford. Therefore, the statement "Manchester United has beaten Portsmouth 2 out of 2 times since 13 August 2005" is refuted by the table.
667	The statement is refuted by the table. Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers only once during the 2005-06 season, and it was on September 24, 2005. Manchester United lost that match 1-2 at home, but they did not play against Blackburn Rovers a second time during that season. Therefore, the statement that Manchester United lost to Blackburn Rovers 2 out of 2 times since August 13, 2005, is not supported by the information in the table.
668	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, there were only 9 games played by Manchester United during the 2005-06 season that had an attendance of 60,000 or more. These games were as follows:1. Aston Villa (H) 20 August 2005 – 67,9342. Manchester City (H) 10 September 2005 – 67,8393. Liverpool (A) 18 September 2005 – 44,9174. Blackburn Rovers (H) 24 September 2005 – 67,7655. Tottenham Hotspur (H) 22 October 2005 – 67,8566. Chelsea (H) 6 November 2005 – 67,8647. Everton (H) 11 December 2005 – 67,8318. Aston Villa (A) 17 December 2005 – 37,1289. Charlton Athletic (H) 7 May 2006 – 73,006Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table, as it indicates that only 9 games had an attendance of 60,000 or more, and not 19.
669	That statement is supported by the table. The row 27, which occurred on 11 February 2006, shows that Manchester United played against Portsmouth with an attendance of 20,206, the lowest attendance in the table. Therefore, the statement "the game with the lowest attendance happened on 11 February 2006" is supported by the information in the table.
670	The statement is refuted by the table. Manchester United played against Portsmouth twice during the 2005-06 season: once on 3 December 2005 and again on 11 February 2006. In both matches, Manchester United won, with the scores of 3-0 and 3-1, respectively. Therefore, Manchester United did not lose 3 out of 3 times to Portsmouth during that season.
671	The statement is refuted by the table. From the table, it can be seen that Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers on September 24, 2005, and April 1, 2006, and they won one of those matches (row 7) and lost the other (row 33), without drawing any of them. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
672	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, the attendance of the game between Manchester United and Arsenal on 9th April 2006 was 70,908. However, there is no other game in the table that has an attendance exactly equal to that of the game between Manchester United and Arsenal on 9th April 2006. Therefore, there have not been 19 games since 13th August 2005 which had an attendance exactly equal to that of the game between Manchester United and Arsenal on 9th April 2006.
673	I'm sorry, but that statement is refuted by the table of the 2005-06 Manchester United F.C. season. The last game of the season is listed as being played on May 7, 2006, against Charlton Athletic, where Manchester United won 4-0. The game played on February 11, 2006, was against Manchester City, which was Manchester United's 24th game of the season out of 38.
674	The statement appears to be supported by the information provided in the table. Looking at the rows that mention the Seattle Mariners as the opponent, we can see that there are a total of three games played against them in September 8, September 9, and September 10, and then another three games played against them in September 17, September 18, and September 19. There are also three games played against the Mariners listed in September 29, September 30, and October 1. Therefore, the Texas Rangers played the Seattle Mariners nine times in the 2006 season as stated in the statement.
675	The statement "all games in the 2006 season were played in the month of September" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the first game listed was played on September 1, 2006, and the final game was played on October 1, 2006. Therefore, not all games were played in the month of September.
676	The statement is not supported by the table. While there was a game with a score of 7-2, it only occurred once in the listed games in the table. The game was against the Cleveland Indians on September 1 and the Texas Rangers lost. The other game scores in the table do not show another instance of a 7-2 final score.
677	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the Texas Rangers played the Tigers on September 12th and September 13th, as indicated in rows 11 and 12 of the table.
678	Refuted. According to the provided table, only one game (September 4th against the Athletics) had a final score of 8-1. While there were several games with a lopsided score, no other game had a final score of exactly 8-1.
679	I'm sorry, but the statement "in the 2006 season the Texas Mariners played the Angels nine times" is not supported by the table. While the Texas Rangers did play the Los Angeles Angels during the 2006 season, they played them a total of four times, not nine. The table shows that they played the Angels on September 14th, September 15th, September 16th, and September 17th.
680	I'm sorry, but the table you provided only includes games played in September and end in October 1st. Therefore, the statement "all games in the 2007 season were played in the month of October" cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table.
681	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the table since it only provides information about the scores, opponents, and records of the Texas Rangers for their games in September and October of 2006, not 2007. There is no information in the table about any game scores in the 2007 season.
682	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. The table only shows the scores, opponents, and records of the Texas Rangers for games played in September and October of 2006, not the 2008 season. Additionally, there is no mention of the team playing against the Tigers in the table.
683	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the given table because none of the rows in the table have a final score of 9-2. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about whether or not the statement is true based on the table related to the 2006 Texas Rangers season.
684	The statement is supported by the table. The episode "Gary and Allison Brooks," which aired on November 19, 2008, had the highest number of viewers of the entire season, with a rating of 2.7 in the 18-49 demographic and 8.14 million viewers.
685	The statement is true. According to the table, the season 1 finale episode of "Gary Unmarried," titled "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal," which aired on May 20, 2009, had the lowest viewership of the season, with a rating of 1.7 in the 18-49 demographic and 5.55 million viewers.
686	The statement "all new episodes of Gary Unmarried Season 1 aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm" is supported by the information in the table. All 21 episodes listed in the table were aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm according to the "timeslot" column.
687	This statement is refuted by the table as none of the episode titles in the first season of Gary Unmarried has the names of both Gary and Allison.
688	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the table you provided. The table only includes data for episodes of "Gary Unmarried" aired between September 2008 and May 2009. Furthermore, December 2009 is not one of the months for which episode data is displayed in the table. Please provide a statement that is relevant to the information included in the table, and I'll do my best to help you determine if it is supported or refuted.
689	The statement "Gary and Allison Brooks was the episode with the least amount of viewers" is refuted by the table provided. According to the table, the episode "Gary and Allison Brooks" had a viewership of 8.14 million, which is higher than the viewership of the episodes "Gary Moves Back In" and "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal". These two episodes had viewerships of 7.07 million and 5.55 million, respectively. Therefore, "Gary and Allison Brooks" was not the episode with the least amount of viewers.
690	The statement "the final episode had the second least views and aired May 6th" is supported by the table. The final episode titled "Gary and His Half Brother," which aired on May 6, 2009, had a rating of 2.0 in the 18-49 demographic and 6.66 million viewers, the second-lowest viewership in the series.
691	I'm sorry, but the statement "Gary Unmarried came on Fridays at 8:00 pm" cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table. The table only provides information about the air date, timeslot, and ratings of each episode of Gary Unmarried, and it shows that the show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm, not Fridays at 8:00 pm.
692	The statement is refuted by the table. While some of the episodes do feature both characters, not every episode title mentions Gary and Allison. Some examples are "Gary Dates Louise's Teacher," "Gary Moves Back In," and "Gary and his Half Brother," which do not mention Allison in their titles. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table.
693	The statement is unsupported by the table. According to the table, the last episode of "Gary Unmarried" aired on May 20, 2009, and there were no episodes that aired in December 2009 or after.
694	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the Boston Celtics had a total of 9 losses in their 1984 - 85 season. This can be seen in row 9, where they lost to the Indiana Pacers, and in row 15, where they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers. Therefore, the statement "the boston celtics only lost three games in the 1984 - 85 season" is false.
695	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As we can see in rows 2 and 3 of the table, the Boston Celtics played two games against the New York Knicks, winning both games with scores of 105-94 and 108-97, respectively. Therefore, the New York Knicks did not win a game against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-85 NBA season.
696	Based on the table you provided, the statement "in the 1984 - 85 season the Boston Celtics played eight games at the Boston Garden" is incorrect. The table shows that the Boston Celtics played 18 games during the 1984-85 season, but only five of those games were played at the Boston Garden. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table - the correct number is five games played at the Boston Garden, not eight.
697	The statement "the Boston Celtics achieved their highest score against the Detroit Pistons in the 1984-85 season" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The highest score in the table is 128-127, which was achieved against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 27, 1985, and not against the Detroit Pistons. The table does not show any game where the Boston Celtics scored higher than 131 points, which was achieved against the Detroit Pistons on January 29, 1985, but the Detroit Pistons actually scored 130 points in that game, and not the Celtics. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
698	The statement "the Chicago Bulls only played the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden during the 1984 - 85 season" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the Boston Celtics played against the Chicago Bulls twice during the 1984-85 season, and one of those games took place at the Boston Garden. The game is listed in row 5 of the table, where the Boston Celtics won 111-108 against the Chicago Bulls on January 9, 1985, at the Boston Garden. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information provided in the table.
699	The statement "the Boston Celtics lost more games than they won in the 1984-1985 season" is refuted by the table. Looking at the "Record" column, we can see that the Celtics won 63.3% of their games, which is shown by their record of 37-9. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
700	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. The Boston Celtics won both away games against the New York Knicks in the 1984 - 1985 season, according to rows 3 and 4 in the table.
701	Based on the information in the table, this statement is not supported. Out of the 46 games played during the 1984-1985 Boston Celtics season, 25 were played at the Boston Garden. That means more than half (54.3%) of the games were played in the Boston Garden. So, the statement "less than half the 1984 - 1985 season games were played in the Boston Garden" is refuted by the information in the table.
702	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The Boston Celtics scored 97 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 20th, which was not the lowest scoring game they played that season.
703	The statement is refuted by the information given in the table. As per the table, the Boston Celtics played several home games against different teams at the Boston Garden, including the Chicago Bulls, and won most of those games. The Celtics' game against the Chicago Bulls on January 9, 1985, at the Boston Garden resulted in a 111-108 win for the Celtics, which is mentioned in row 5 of the table. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
704	Based on the table you provided, I can confirm that the statement "the Utah Jazz had six players from the United States" is supported. From the table, we see that Rick Adelman, Louis Amundson, J.J. Anderson, Shandon Anderson, Carlos Arroyo, and Isaac Austin were all from the United States. Therefore, the statement is true.
705	This statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows players from different positions (guard, center, forward), but it does show that two players from the schools Georgia and Penn State have played for the Utah Jazz. These players are Shandon Anderson from Georgia (row 5) and John Amaechi from Penn State (row 3). So, the statement is supported for the part that mentions the schools, but the part about the positions is not entirely accurate.
706	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that after 2000, the Utah Jazz roster included players from England, the United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico, with each country contributing one player. John Amaechi from England, Louis Amundson from the United States, Rafael Araújo from Brazil, and Carlos Arroyo from Puerto Rico all played for the Utah Jazz during or after 2000.
707	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that out of the 10 players listed, nine of them are from the United States, with only one from England and one from Brazil. Therefore, the majority of the players on the Utah Jazz all-time roster are from the United States, which supports the statement that the United States contributed the most players of all the countries.
708	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement appears to be supported. There are ten players listed in the table and four of them are from the United States: Rick Adelman, J J Anderson, Shandon Anderson, and Louis Amundson. The table indicates that Louis Amundson played for the Utah Jazz in 2007, which is after 1985. Therefore, the statement correctly states that after 1985, the United States contributed four players, with Louis Amundson being the most recent.
709	The statement is incorrect. The table shows that there are more than three players from the United States in the Utah Jazz all-time roster. At least 7 of the 10 players listed in the table are from the United States including Rick Adelman, Louis Amundson, J.J. Anderson, Shandon Anderson, Carlos Arroyo, Isaac Austin, and Anthony Avent. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
710	Based on the information presented in the table, this statement is partially supported. The table lists two schools, Georgia and Penn State, but only one of them contributed a player of the specified position. Shandon Anderson, who played for three seasons with the Jazz from 1996-1999, was listed as a guard/forward and attended the University of Georgia. However, John Amaechi, who played for the Jazz from 2001-2003, was listed as a center/forward and attended Penn State. Therefore, only Penn State contributed a player at the center position, while Georgia contributed a player at the guard/forward position.
711	Based on the information in the table, the statement "after 2000, only Brazil and England contributed one player to the Utah Jazz" is supported. John Amaechi from England and Rafael Araujo from Brazil are the only players from those countries who played for the Utah Jazz after 2000, as indicated in rows 3 and 7 of the table. All the other players listed in the table are from the United States, except for Carlos Arroyo from Puerto Rico.
712	Based on the table provided, the statement "of all the countries, England contributed the most players of all the countries" is refuted. The table only includes one player from England, John Amaechi, and there are players from other countries such as the United States, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and others. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
713	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at the nationality column in the table, all players listed after J.J. Anderson in row 5 are from the United States except for Rafael Araújo, who is from Brazil. Since Araújo is listed as the most recent non-US player on the Utah Jazz roster, it supports the statement that "after 1985, the United States contributed two players with Rafael Araújo being the most recent."
714	The statement is supported by the table. The first episode, "omae ga hosii," was broadcasted on May 10, 2010, and the second episode, "arienai kisu," was broadcasted seven days later, on May 17, 2010.
715	The statement is refuted by the table. The episode with the earliest broadcast date is "omae ga hosii" with a broadcast date of May 10, 2010, and a rating of 22.4%. The episode "arienai kisu" which is the second episode in the series has a lower rating of 19.2%, which is a difference of 3.2%. Therefore, it can be concluded that "arienai kisu" had 3.2% less ratings than the title with the earliest broadcast date.
716	That statement is supported by the table. As per the given table:- Episode 1 "omae ga hosii" was broadcasted on May 10, 2010.- Episode 2 "arienai kisu" was broadcasted on May 17, 2010.- Episode 3 "fukusyū no puropōzu" was broadcasted on May 24, 2010.- Episode 4 "konna ni suki dattanda…" was broadcasted on May 31, 2010.- Episode 5 "suki to ietara iinoni" was broadcasted on June 7, 2010.- Episode 6 "saishūshōjomakuwakare" was broadcasted on June 14, 2010.As we can see, episode 5 "suki to ietara iinoni" had the second-most recent broadcast date, which supports the given statement.
717	The statement "fukusyū no puropōzu had 2.2% higher ratings than the title with the most recent broadcast date" cannot be determined from the table provided. The table contains information about the episode titles, their broadcast dates, and ratings. It does not include ratings for the most recent episode or any episode after "saishūshōjomakuwakare", the last episode listed in the table. Therefore, there is no way to compare the ratings of "fukusyū no puropōzu" with the ratings of the most recent episode. In conclusion, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table.
718	The statement is supported by the table. The episode "suki to ietara iinoni" had a rating of 17.4%, which was 4% higher than the episode with the lowest ratings, "saishūshōjomakuwakare" that had a rating of 13.4%.
719	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The first episode, "omae ga hosii," was broadcasted on May 10, 2010. The second episode, "arienai kisu," was broadcasted 14 days after the first episode on May 17, 2010. Therefore, the statement that "arienai kisu was broadcasted 14 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date" is correct according to the given table.
720	I apologize, but I must refute the statement provided. According to the table, "arienai kisu" had a rating of 19.2% and was broadcast on May 17, 2010. Meanwhile, "omae ga hosii" had a rating of 22.4% and was broadcast on May 10, 2010. Therefore, the statement "arienai kisu had 5.8% more ratings than the title with the earliest broadcast date" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
721	The statement "fukusyū no puropōzu had the 2nd most recent broadcast date" is unsupported by the data in the table. According to the table, the broadcast date for fukusyū no puropōzu was May 24, 2010, which was the third episode in the series. The fourth and fifth episodes were broadcast on May 31 and June 7, respectively, which are more recent than May 24. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
722	Unfortunately, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided since it only contains the ratings data for "Tsuki no Koibito" episodes, and doesn't have information on any other titles that may have had a more recent broadcast date.
723	The statement is supported by the table. The lowest-rated episode is "saishūshōjomakuwakare" with a rating of 13.4%. The episode "suki to ietara iinoni" has a rating of 17.4%, which is 5.8% higher than the lowest-rated episode. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
724	The statement "south dragons won the most games in the season" is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the South Dragons had the lowest number of lost games (8) compared to all the other teams. They also had the highest percentage points (110.25) and the highest percentage won (73.33%). Additionally, they had the second-highest number of wins in their home games (13 - 2) and the third-highest number of wins in their away games (9 - 6). Therefore, we can conclude that the South Dragons won the most games in the 2008-09 NBL season, based on the data presented in the table.
725	The statement that "the Melbourne Tigers have the same away record as South Dragons," is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the South Dragons had a record of 9-6 for away games, and the Melbourne Tigers had an identical record of 9-6 for away games. Therefore, the statement is true based on the data presented in the table.
726	The statement "the new zealand breakers lost two games more than the melbourne tigers" is supported by the table. According to the table, the New Zealand Breakers lost 12 games (as seen in row 4), whereas the Melbourne Tigers lost 10 games (as seen in row 3). Therefore, the New Zealand Breakers lost two games more than the Melbourne Tigers.
727	The statement is supported by the table. The Gold Coast Blaze had the most losses (22) and the lowest percentage of games won (26.67%) compared to all other teams in the 2008-09 NBL season, indicating that they had the worst record of all the teams in the league during that season.
728	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, both the Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles have lost 13 games during the 2008-09 NBL season.
729	The statement "gold coast blaze won the most games in the season" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Gold Coast Blaze won only 4 out of their 28 games, which is the least number of games won by any team in the 2008-09 NBL season. South Dragons won the most games in the season, winning 22 out of their 28 games.
730	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, South Dragons have a home record of 13-2, while Melbourne Tigers have a home record of 11-4, which means that they have the same number of wins at home (11). Therefore, the statement "Melbourne Tigers have the same home record as South Dragons" is supported by the table.
731	This statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the New Zealand Breakers had 10 losses during the 2008-09 NBL season, whereas the Melbourne Tigers had 12 losses. Therefore, the New Zealand Breakers won two games more than the Melbourne Tigers as they lost fewer games.
732	The statement "gold coast blaze had the best record in the season" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The Gold Coast Blaze had a record of 26.67% won and lost 22 games, which is the worst record in the table. The South Dragons had the best record in the season, with a 73.33% winning percentage and only 8 losses, according to the information in the table.
733	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. Both Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles have a 56.67% record for the season under the column titled "% won".
734	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the match on 7 March 2001 against Portsmouth had an attendance of 20503, and the match on 21 February 2001 against Nottingham Forest had an attendance of 23266.
735	The statement "the match with the highest attendance was against Sheffield United" is supported by the table. The attendance for the match against Sheffield United, which was played away, was not included in the table, but the match against Sheffield United that was played at home on 1 April 2001, had a total attendance of 38,433, which was the highest among all the matches listed in the table.
736	That statement is supported by the table for the 2000 - 01 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season. The games in which no goals were scored by either side are:- 28 December 2000: Sheffield Wednesday vs Bolton Wanderers- 30 December 2000: Huddersfield Town vs Sheffield Wednesday- 6 May 2001: Sheffield Wednesday vs Crewe AlexandraAll three results are mentioned as 0 - 0 in the "result" column of the table.
737	According to the table about the Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season 2000-01, the statement is supported. The match played on April 14th, 2001 against Crystal Palace was won with a score of 4-1, while the match played on February 24th, 2001 against Blackburn Rovers was lost with a score of 0-2.
738	Refuted. The table shows that the shortest time between two consecutive matches was 3 days, as there is a gap of 26th and 29th December 2000 between the games against Wolverhampton Wanderers (home) and Bolton Wanderers (away).
739	The statement is refuted by the table. The match on February 21, 2001, between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday, had an attendance of 23,266, which is less than 25,000. The match on March 7, 2001, between Sheffield Wednesday and Portsmouth, had an attendance of 20,503, which is also less than 25,000. Therefore, the statement that the matches on March 7, 2001, and February 21, 2001, both had attendances over 25,000 is not supported by the information in the table.
740	The statement "the match with the highest attendance was against birmingham city" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the match with the highest attendance was against Sheffield United, with a total attendance of 38,433 people. The match against Birmingham City had an attendance of 14,695 people, which is much lower than the attendance for the match against Sheffield United.
741	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 27, 46, and 47 all had matches where no goals were scored by either team. Additionally, in row 40, the game between Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham City ended in a score of 0-0, meaning that there were indeed four different games without any goals scored by either side.
742	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The match on April 14, 2001 against Crystal Palace was a victory (4-1), but the match on February 24, 2001, against Preston North End was a defeat (0-2).
743	Looking at the information in the table, I can see that there were only two matches played by Sheffield Wednesday in March 2001, which were on the 3rd and 7th. Therefore, the statement "the shortest time between two consecutive matches in March was two days" is refuted by the table, as there were no consecutive matches played in March by Sheffield Wednesday.
744	The table shows that Olga Govortsova has not reached the finals in any Grand Slam tournament. Therefore, the statement "Olga Govortsova has never reached the finals in a Grand Slam tournament" is supported by the table.
745	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the quarterfinals in the Cincinnati tournament in 2007. Additionally, she reached the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009, and the second round in other Grand Slam tournaments.
746	The statement is refuted by the table. From the table, we can see that Olga Govortsova did not win any Grand Slam Tournament matches in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Therefore, it is not true that Olga Govortsova won at least one Grand Slam Tournament match in any given year between 2007 and 2011.
747	The statement that Olga Govortsova's WTA Year-End ranking has never gone up from 2007-2011 is supported by the table. The year-end rankings for Olga Govortsova in the given years are as follows:- 2007: 49- 2008: 49- 2009: 52- 2010: 74- 2011: 114As we can see from the table, Olga Govortsova's year-end ranking has never increased from 2007 to 2011. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
748	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova participated in the French Open tournament from 2008 to 2011. In both 2008 and 2009, she advanced to the third round of the tournament. Therefore, the statement that Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open two years in a row is supported by the information presented in the table.
749	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "Olga Govortsova reached the finals in a Grand Slam tournament" is refuted. The table shows that her best performance in Grand Slam tournaments was reaching the third round at the French Open in 2008 and 2009. She did not advance beyond the third round in any other Grand Slam tournaments and her win-loss record in Grand Slam tournaments was not particularly strong over the years.
750	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round of the French Open in both 2008 and 2009, and to the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati tournament in 2010. Therefore, the furthest she has advanced in a grand slam tournament is not the second round, but the third round.
751	Refuted. The table shows that Olga Govortsova did not win at least five Grand Slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007-2011. The highest number of Grand Slam tournament matches that she won in a single year during that period was three, which occurred in 2008, 2009, and 2011.
752	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova's year-end ranking on the WTA tour went down from 2008 to 2009, and from 2009 to 2010, and also from 2010 to 2011, which means her year-end ranking did not always go up throughout the years 2007 to 2011. Therefore, the statement "from 2007 - 2011, olga govortsova's wta year - end ranking has always gone up" is refuted by the table.
753	The statement "Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open five years in a row" is refuted by the table. According to the table, while Govortsova did reach the third round in the French Open twice in her career (in 2008 and 2009), she did not achieve this feat for five consecutive years. In 2010 and 2011, she was eliminated in the second round of the French Open, and therefore did not make it to the third round those years.
754	Yes, the statement "only one match resulted in the result of a draw" is supported by the table. Row 10 states that Tim Lajcik had a draw against Ron Waterman in UFC 22. None of the other rows in the table show a draw, so the statement is accurate.
755	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "there were more win results than loss results" is supported. There are a total of 15 rows in the table, with 9 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw listed. Therefore, the number of win results is greater than the number of loss results.
756	Based on the provided table, the statement "only two matches were played through three rounds" is supported. Rows four and ten are the only two matches that went through three rounds, while other matches ended in the first or second rounds.
757	Yes, that statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to row 8, Tim Lajcik won his match against Joe Campanella with a TKO in just 18 seconds, making it the shortest match on the table.
758	The statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. While the table includes a match where Tim Lajcik won against Eugene Jackson, that match is listed in row 13 as having a total time of 9 minutes and 49 seconds, making it the third-longest match in the table. The match with the longest time is listed in row 4, where Tim Lajcik won against Osami Shibuya with a decision (unanimous) after a full three rounds of fighting, which took a total time of 15 minutes (5 minutes per round).
759	The statement "two matches resulted in the result of a draw" is supported by the information in the table. Row 10 shows a draw in the record column, indicating that one match resulted in a draw.
760	Based on the information in the table, the statement "there were fewer win results than loss results" is false. There are eight wins listed in the table, while there are seven losses and one draw. Therefore, there were more win results than loss results.
761	Based on the information in the table, we can see that there are five matches that were played through three rounds - row 4, row 6, row 10, row 12, and row 13. Therefore, the statement "more than two matches were played through three rounds" is supported by the table.
762	The statement "the match with the shortest time was won against borislav jeliazkov" is not supported by the table. Tim Lajcik lost to Borislav Jeliazkov by submission (rear naked choke) in the first round, which lasted for 2 minutes and 23 seconds. The win with the shortest time was against Paul Devich, which Tim won by TKO in the first round and the match lasted only 1 minute and 20 seconds.
763	The statement "the match with the longest time was won against David Ross" is not supported by the table. The longest match length in the table is 9 minutes and 49 seconds, which was against Eugene Jackson, and Tim Lajcik won that fight by submission (rear naked choke). The match against David Ross lasted 5 minutes and 36 seconds, and Lajcik won that fight by TKO.
764	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The table shows the results of the first 13 games played by the Denver Nuggets during the 2009-10 season. Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer for the Nuggets in 12 out of the 13 games played in November, as indicated by the "high points" column in each row of the table. In 12 of the 13 games, Anthony scored over 20 points, and in one game, he scored an incredible 50 points, leading the team to victory. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
765	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement appears to be supported. The table shows that the Nuggets played a total of six games at the Pepsi Center during this span, and they won all six of those games. This can be seen in the "location attendance" column, where the attendance for each of the six games at the Pepsi Center is listed, along with the final score and the Nuggets' record for that game. Therefore, the statement "the Nuggets won all six games played at the Pepsi Center during this span" is supported by the information in the table.
766	The statement is supported by the table. The attendance column in the table shows that for all the games that were played at the Pepsi Center (where the Nuggets played their home games), the attendance was over 15,000. In fact, the attendance for every game at the Pepsi Center was above 15,000, except for one game against the Nets where it was 16,307. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement about attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center being over 15,000 is supported by the table.
767	The statement is supported by the table. As per the given table, the Denver Nuggets had a record of 6-2 after their second game in November. They lost their next game against the Milwaukee Bucks, then won against the Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors, and Chicago Bulls, and lost against the Los Angeles Clippers. However, they went on to win their next four games against the Nets, Timberwolves, Knicks, and Wizards. Therefore, they did not lose more than one game in a row during November, as they won at least one game between each of their losses.
768	Based on the table provided, the statement "chauncey billups led or was tied for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games" is supported by the information in the table. In rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 14, Chauncey Billups is listed as the player who recorded the most assists or was tied for the most assists in the game. This means that in those 10 out of 13 games, Billups led or tied for the lead in assists.
769	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table data, Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer for the Nuggets in 10 out of the 13 games played in November 2009. In rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, the "high points" column shows that Carmelo Anthony scored the most points for the Nuggets in those games.
770	The statement is refuted by the information provided in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the Nuggets played 6 games at Pepsi Center during this span and that they won 5 of those games - on November 1 vs. Grizzlies, November 4 vs. Nets, November 10 vs. Bulls, November 13 vs. Lakers, and November 24 vs. Nets. They only lost one game at Pepsi Center during this period, which was on November 7 against the Hawks. Therefore, the statement that the Nuggets lost all six games played at Pepsi Center during this span is not true.
771	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. The attendance for the game on November 10 against the Bulls was 21,409, but the attendance for all other games at the Pepsi Center, including the games that went into overtime, was below 19,000. The highest attendance for any other game was 19,359 on November 13 against the Lakers. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
772	According to the table, the Denver Nuggets had two losses during the month of November. However, they never lost two games in a row during that month. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
773	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Ty Lawson led or was tied for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games" is not supported. While Ty Lawson did lead or tie for the lead in assists in some of the games (e.g., November 4th game against the Nets, where he had 5 assists tied for the lead with Chauncey Billups), the table does not indicate that he did so in 10 out of 13 games. The table only provides information on the high assists for each game, which is not always Ty Lawson. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
774	The statement "the lowest attendance figure for a game was 12376" is supported by the table. According to row 5 of the table, the game against Washington on February 9 had an attendance of 12376, which is the lowest attendance figure listed in the table.
775	Based on the information in the table, the statement "Stephen Jackson led the team in points for the most games" appears to be supported. Looking at the table, we can see that Stephen Jackson is listed as the high scorer for five out of the eleven games in February that are mentioned in this table. In comparison, no other player is listed as the high scorer for more than two games during this period. Therefore, it seems that Stephen Jackson did indeed lead the team in points for the most games during the time frame covered by this table.
776	Unfortunately, the table provided does not support or refute the given statement since the highest number of rebounds by a Bobcats player in any of the listed games is 17 by Nazr Mohammed in the game against the LA Lakers on February 3. The table does not show any Bobcats player having 20 or more rebounds in any of the games listed. Therefore, we can neither confirm nor deny if the statement is true based on the information present in the table.
777	The statement "Raymond Felton led the team in assists 4 different times" is supported by the information presented in the table. In row 1 under the "high assists" column, we can see that Raymond Felton had the highest number of assists (4) during the game against the Portland Trail Blazers on February 1, 2010. Therefore, the statement is true, and Raymond Felton led the team in assists at least one time during the 2009-10 Charlotte Bobcats season.
778	Looking at the table of the 2009-10 Charlotte Bobcats season, we can see that from game 47 to game 56, they won three games (games 50, 51, and 53) and lost seven games (games 47, 48, 49, 52, 54, 55, and 56). Therefore, the statement "the bobcats had a record of 3 wins and 7 losses" is supported by the table.
779	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "location attendance" column, we can see that the attendance for the game against Washington on February 9 was 12376, which is the second lowest attendance figure listed in the table. The lowest attendance was 12,712 for the game against New Jersey on February 16. Therefore, the statement is correct.
780	The statement seems to be supported by the information in the table. Stephen Jackson is listed as the high scorer for five out of the ten games in the table, while other players such as Raymond Felton, Gerald Wallace, and Tyrus Thomas also have games where they led the team in points. Since five games out of ten is less than half, it appears that Stephen Jackson did not lead the team in points for more than half of the games listed. Therefore, the statement "Stephen Jackson led the team in points for less than half the games" is supported by the table.
781	Unfortunately, the table does not provide enough information to support or refute the statement that "the second most rebounds by a Bobcats player in one game was 20." The table only provides information about individual game statistics, such as scores, high points, high rebounds, etc., but it doesn't include any information about aggregate statistics or historical records. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny the statement based on the information provided in the table.
782	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "raymond felton led the team in assists less than four different times" is refuted. According to the table, Raymond Felton led the team in assists on 3 different occasions - February 1st vs Portland, February 6th vs New Orleans, and February 25th vs Phoenix. Therefore, he did not lead the team in assists less than four different times, but exactly three times during the period covered by the table.
783	According to the table, the Charlotte Bobcats had a record of 27 wins and 29 losses during the 2009-10 season. Therefore, the statement "the Bobcats had a record of more wins than losses" is refuted by the table.
784	The statement "the Hurricanes won 90% of their games in 2007 which got them promoted to a higher division" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, the Hurricanes won 9 out of 10 games in the 2007 season, which gives them a 90% win rate. However, it was not solely the win rate that got them promoted to a higher division. In fact, the Hurricanes were promoted to Division 1 North after finishing in 6th place out of 11 teams in Division 2 North. Therefore, the table suggests that it was not solely their win rate that led to their promotion.
785	The statement "the Dundee Hurricanes had two losing seasons, in 2006 and 2009" is supported by the table. In 2006, the Hurricanes had 3 wins and 4 losses, and in 2009, they had 2 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie. Therefore, they had losing records in both of those seasons.
786	The statement "the highest number of ties in a season by the hurricanes was in 2008" is supported by the table of results. The table shows that in 2008, the team had a total of 3 ties, which is the highest number of ties in a single season, as compared to the other seasons listed in the table.
787	The statement "the dundee hurricanes won the same number of games in 2003 and 2004" is supported by the table. If we look at row 2 and row 3, we see that the hurricanes won 6 games in both seasons. Therefore, the statement is true as confirmed by the table.
788	The statement "the 2009 Hurricanes season resulted in the lowest final position" is supported by the table. In the 2009 season, the Hurricanes had a final position of 5 out of 7 teams, which is their lowest final position among all the seasons listed in the table.
789	The statement is not supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, in 2007, the Hurricanes won 9 out of 10 games, which is a winning percentage of 90%. Additionally, they were promoted to a higher division (Division 1 North) that year.
790	Based on the table provided, the statement "the Dundee Hurricanes had four losing seasons, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008" is supported by the information presented in the table. In 2003, the team had 4 losses and 6 wins, so it could be considered a losing season. In 2005, the team had 5 wins and 5 losses, which is also considered a losing season. In 2007, the Hurricanes had only one loss, but they had 9 wins, still they did not manage to finish in the first 6 positions of the league, so it could also be considered a losing season. In 2008, the team had 5 wins, 2 losses, and 3 ties, which could also be considered a losing season. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
791	The statement "the highest number of ties in a season by the hurricanes was in 2003" is supported by the table. According to the table, in the 2003 season, the Dundee Hurricanes had 0 ties. Therefore, the statement is false for that season.In 2004, they had 1 tie. In 2008, they had 3 ties. However, in neither of those seasons did they have more ties than the other seasons. Therefore, the highest number of ties in a season by the Hurricanes was in fact in 2008.
792	The statement is supported by the table. As we can see from the table, the number of wins varies from season to season between the years 2003 and 2009; e.g., they won 6 matches in 2003 and 2004, but their win for 2005 was down to 5, and in the 2006 season, they won only 3 matches. Therefore, the dundee hurricanes did not win the same number of games in any of the seasons they played between 2003 and 2009.
793	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "only three of the projects have been completed so far" appears to be refuted. According to the table, at least five of the projects have been completed: the Flowood Site in Rankin county, with construction completed on 09/17/1993, partially deleted on an unknown date, and deleted on 02/16/1996; the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals site in Marion county, with construction completed on 08/08/1997, partially deleted on an unknown date, and deleted on 09/27/2000; the Davis Timber Company site in Lamar county, which was listed on 07/27/2000 and appears to have no further action required; the Sonford Products site in Rankin county, with construction completed on an unknown date; and the Walcott Chemical Co Warehouses site in Washington county, which had cleanup completed before the formal creation of NPL (National Priorities List) on 12/30/1982 and was deleted on the same day. Therefore, since at least five of the listed sites have been completed or deleted, the statement appears to be refuted.
794	According to the table of superfund sites in Mississippi, there are two sites that were proposed but never listed. These two sites are:- Chemfax, Inc (msd008154486)- Potter Co (msd056029648)However, the table does not provide information about whether or not these two projects were completed. Therefore, the statement "two of the projects were proposed, but never listed and never completed" is only partially supported by the table.
795	The statement that "there were two projects in Rankin County, Sonford Products, and Flowood site" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, there were two projects in Rankin County: Flowood site (MSD980710941) and Sonford Products (MSD086556388). Both of these were listed as proposed for cleanup on September 8, 1983, and September 27, 2006, respectively. The Flowood site was later listed on September 21, 1984, while Sonford Products was listed on March 7, 2007, for cleanup. The construction for the Flowood site was completed on September 17, 1993, and it was deleted partially on February 16, 1996. However, there is no information about the status of the Sonford Products project in the table.
796	According to the table, the statement is correct. The table shows that the Potter Co site was proposed on May 10, 1993, but it has not yet been listed as a superfund site. Therefore, the information in the table supports the statement that the first project proposed was Potter Co in Copiah, but it has not yet been listed.
797	The statement is partially supported by the table. According to the table, construction was completed on the Flowood site in 1993, which supports the first part of the statement. However, for the Newsome Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals project, construction was completed in 1997, but the site was only partially deleted and was not fully deleted until 2000, as indicated in the table. Therefore, while construction was completed in 1997 on that project, the site was not fully deleted until later, which suggests that more work was done beyond construction, and the statement should include additional information about the deletion process.
798	I'm sorry, but that statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table contains five completed projects, not three, and their completion dates range from 1982 to 2000. Here are the details of the construction completion dates in the table:- MSD980710941 (Flowood Site) - 09/17/1993- MSD980840045 (Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.) - 08/08/1997- MSD056029648 (Potter Co) - N/A- MSD086556388 (Sonford Products) - N/A- MSD980601736 (Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses) - 12/30/1982As you can see, there are two projects with completed dates in the timeframe specified (1993-1997), but there are also projects outside that range. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
799	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is partially supported. Two projects, "Chemfax, Inc" and "Potter Co," were proposed and listed during 1993 but there is no information on whether they were completed or not. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that they were never completed. The table does not provide information on the completion status of these two projects. The other listed projects in the table have either been completed or deleted.
800	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the "flowood site" in Rankin county was both proposed and listed on 09/08/1983 and 09/21/1984, respectively. In addition, the "sonford products" site in Rankin county was also proposed and listed on 09/27/2006 and 03/07/2007, respectively. Therefore, there were indeed multiple projects that were proposed and listed in Rankin county according to the information presented in the table.
801	Based on the information in the table, the statement "Potter Co in Copiah was the first project proposed but the last to be listed" is refuted. While it is listed in the table as "MSD056029648," it is shown to have been proposed on May 10, 1993, and there is no information about whether it was listed or not. Therefore, the information in the table does not support the statement that Potter Co in Copiah was the first project proposed but the last to be listed.
802	Based on the information in the table, the statement is not supported. Although both the Flowood Site and the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. site were proposed in the same year of 1984, the construction for the Flowood site was started and completed at different times - construction started on September 8, 1983, and completed on September 17, 1993, while the construction for the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. site started on October 15, 1984, and was completed on August 8, 1997. Therefore, the construction was not completed during the same time frame of 1993 at both sites.
803	The statement "there were 13 tour matches in the last 3 months of 1978" is supported by the table. The table shows 19 rows, out of which the first 13 rows represent tour matches that were played between 18th October 1978 and 13th December 1978. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
804	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "there were 4 test matches in the last 2 months of 1978" is supported. The table shows that there were four matches labeled as "test match" in the period from November 4 to December 9, which falls within the last two months of 1978. These matches were between New Zealand and Ireland, Wales, England, and Scotland, respectively.
805	The statement is partially supported by the table. According to the table, only one team scored exactly 12 points against Cambridge University during the 1978 New Zealand Rugby Union Tour of Britain and Ireland. That team was London Counties, as shown in row 5 of the table. Therefore, the statement that there were four teams that scored exactly 12 against Cambridge University is refuted.
806	According to the table, there was a tour match held on October 28, 1978, at Twickenham, London, where New Zealand played against London Counties and won with a score of 12-0. However, there was no test match held at Twickenham, London, in November during the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland. Therefore, the statement is partially supported by the table.
807	According to the table, the statement "there were 5 matches held in October of 1978" is supported as there were four tour matches played against Cambridge University, Cardiff, West Wales XV, and London Counties, and one test match played against Ireland, all of which took place in October 1978.
808	The statement "all 4 test matches took place in October of 1978" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, there were only two test matches played during the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland: one against Ireland on November 4, 1978, and another against Wales on November 11, 1978. The other matches listed in the table were not official test matches, but rather tour matches played against various club and regional teams in Britain and Ireland. These tour matches took place between October 18, 1978, and December 16, 1978.
809	Based on the table provided, the statement "no team scored more than 10 against Cambridge University" is refuted. According to the table, the New Zealand rugby team scored 12 points against Cambridge University on October 18, 1978. This means that the opposing team scored more than 10 points against Cambridge University.
810	The statement "all matches held in November in Twickenham, London were tour matches" is refuted by the table. While one match was indeed a tour match against London Counties on October 28, 1978, the other match played in Twickenham in November was a test match against England on November 25, 1978. Therefore, not all the matches held in Twickenham, London in November were tour matches.
811	The statement is refuted by the table. There are only three matches listed in the table that were held in October, and all of them took place before the 25th of the month. The matches against Cambridge University and Cardiff were on October 18th and 21st respectively, while the match against West Wales XV was on October 25th. Therefore, the statement that all five matches held in October of 1978 took place after the 25th of the month is incorrect based on the information presented in the table.
812	The statement appears to be supported by the information presented in the table for the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season. Row 2 of the table shows that on September 1st, 1997, the Blue Jays played the Mets, and won the game by a score of 3-0. The attendance listed in the same row is 19,196, which matches the attendance given in the statement.
813	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 22 of the table, on September 22, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the New York Yankees and won with a score of 8 - 1. The attendance for that game was 23,380. Therefore, the statement "on September 22nd, 23,380 people witnessed a win against the Yankees of 8 - 1" is supported by the information in the table.
814	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the Blue Jays' record on September 28 after their win against the Red Sox was 76-86.
815	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9 in the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Los Angeles Angels on September 8th and won the game 12-10. Therefore, the highest scoring game of the season for the Toronto Blue Jays was against the Los Angeles Angels on September 8th, and the statement is supported by the information in the table.
816	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 25 of the table, on September 25th, the game was indeed against the Orioles, and the final score was 4-3. The attendance was also 28324, which matches the statement. Therefore, we can say that the statement about the September 25th game is supported by the information presented in the table.
817	The statement cannot be refuted or supported based on the table provided because it only lists the scores for the Toronto Blue Jays' games during September of 1997 but does not present the scores from any other team's games. Therefore, we do not know whether the combined runs on September 1st, which was 3-0, was the lowest of any game that month played by any team.
818	The statement is supported by the table. The last row in the table shows that on September 28, the Blue Jays played against the Red Sox and lost 3-2, bringing their record for the season to 76-86.
819	Refuted - the table shows that the Blue Jays scored 12 runs only once during the month of September, on September 27th against the Red Sox. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
820	The statement "Mike Mussina got the win in the September 25th game against the Orioles" is supported by the table. The row for September 25th shows that the Blue Jays played the Orioles and won 4-3. The pitcher for the Orioles is listed as Mussina with a record of 15-8, while the Blue Jays' pitcher is listed as Carpenter with a record of 1-7. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mussina pitched for the Orioles but was given the loss in the game, while Carpenter pitched for the Blue Jays and was not credited with the win.
821	The statement "Dundee west has lower swing to gain points than western isles" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the swing to gain in Dundee West is 2.13, while the swing to gain in Western Isles is 2.91. Therefore, Western Isles has a higher swing to gain than Dundee West, not a lower one.
822	The statement "all of the constituency has 2nd SNP's place 2003" is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the following constituencies did not have SNP as the second-place party in the 2003 general election: - Galloway & Upper Nithsdale (2nd to Conservatives) - Tweeddale, Ettrick & Lauderdale (2nd to Liberal Democrats) - Cumbernauld & Kilsyth (2nd to Labour) Therefore, the statement that all constituencies had the SNP as the second-place party in the 2003 general election is not accurate.
823	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the winning party in Galloway & Upper Nithsdale in the 2003 Scottish Parliament general election was the Conservative party, as stated in the statement. Similarly, the table shows that the winning party in Paisley South in the 2003 election was Labour, which is also stated in the statement. Therefore, the information presented in the table supports the statement.
824	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Glasgow Govan is one of the constituencies where the result was an SNP gain. It can be seen in row 8, where the winning party in 2003 was Labour, but the SNP won the seat in the 2007 election. So, Glasgow Govan is one of the four constituencies where the SNP managed to gain a seat in the Scottish Parliament General Election of 2007.
825	The statement "0.17 is the lowest swing to gain points in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007" is supported by the information provided in the table. According to the table, in the constituency of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, the winning party in 2003 was the Conservative party, and they maintained their hold on the seat in the 2007 election with a swing to gain of just 0.17 points. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
826	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the constituency of Dundee West had a swing to gain of 2.13, while the constituency of Western Isles had a swing to gain of 2.91. Therefore, Dundee West had a lower swing to gain point than Western Isles.
827	The statement "all of the constituency has 3rd SNP's place 2003" is refuted by the information presented in the table. In the table, some constituencies like Galloway & Upper Nithsdale, Tweeddale, Ettrick & Lauderdale, and Cumbernauld & Kilsyth did not have the SNP in the 3rd place in the 2003 election, while others like Kilmarnock & Loudoun, Dundee West, Western Isles, and Glasgow Govan did have the SNP in the 2nd place, indicating a relatively strong performance by the party in those constituencies in the previous election.
828	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the winning party in Galloway & Upper Nithsdale in 2003 was the Conservative Party, not the Liberal Democrats. Similarly, the winning party in Paisley South in 2003 was the Labour Party, which is in agreement with the statement.
829	The statement "Glasgow Govan is one of the five constituencies with a result as SNP gain" is supported by the table. Looking at the "result" column, we can see that in Glasgow Govan, the winning party in 2003 was Labour, but there was a swing to the SNP of 2.92, which resulted in the SNP gaining the seat in the 2007 election. Furthermore, if we examine the rows for Kilmarnock & Loudoun, Dundee West, Western Isles, and Cumbernauld & Kilsyth, we can see that these constituencies also had a "result" of SNP gain, in addition to Glasgow Govan.
830	Based on the table provided, the statement "0.17 is the highest swing to gain points in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007" is refuted. In the table, the constituency with the highest swing to gain is Kilmarnock & Loudoun, with a swing of 1.92 points. The constituency with the lowest swing to gain is Galloway & Upper Nithsdale, with a swing of 0.17 points. Therefore, the statement that 0.17 is the highest swing to gain points in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007 is not supported by the data presented in the table.
831	That statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Steve Stricker had a score of 139, which is 3 strokes under par. In comparison, Phil Mickelson had a score of 143, which is 3 strokes over par. Therefore, Steve Stricker had a lower score than Phil Mickelson in the 2006 U.S. Open (Golf).
832	The statement "Pádraig Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland" is incorrect and is refuted by the information provided in the table. In fact, the table shows another player from Northern Ireland, Graeme McDowell, who tied for 7th place with a score of +3. Therefore, the statement is not correct, and we can see this from the table.
833	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Kenneth Ferrie from England and Geoff Ogilvy from Australia were the only players who scored +1 to par, at a total score of 141. All the other players had a score either below or above +1 to par.
834	The statement is supported by the table. Steve Stricker is listed as the top-ranked player in the 2006 US Open golf tournament, with a score of 139 and a to-par score of -1. He is also identified as being from the United States. Therefore, Steve Stricker had the best score out of all the players from the United States.
835	The statement "there are 5 players that are from the United States" is supported by the table as there are 5 players from the United States in the table. They are Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Jason Dufner, and Arron Oberholser.
836	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Steve Stricker (of the United States) scored 70+69=139 (1 under par), while Phil Mickelson (also of the United States) scored 70+73=143 (3 over par). Therefore, it can be seen from the table that Steve Stricker of the United States had a lower score than Phil Mickelson of the United States.
837	The statement is incorrect. The provided table shows that Pádraig Harrington is from Ireland, not Northern Ireland. Although Graeme McDowell is from Northern Ireland, the statement uses the word "both," which implies that both Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell are from Northern Ireland, which contradicts the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
838	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, Kenneth Ferrie of England and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia were both tied at the 3rd position with a score of +1 to par. No other player in the tournament had a score of +1 to par, thus confirming that only Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy scored a +1 to par.
839	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, Steve Stricker of the United States has the lowest score among all the players with a score of 70 + 69 = 139, which is one stroke under par. No other player in the tournament has a lower score than him. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
840	The statement "there are more players from England than the United States during the event in the 2nd round" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that there were only two players from England (Kenneth Ferrie and Colin Montgomerie) competing in the 2nd round, while there were five players from the United States (Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Jason Dufner, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser).
841	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the match between Hawthorn and Collingwood that was played at Princes Park had a crowd of 23,830, whereas the match between Fitzroy and Carlton that was played at Junction Oval had a larger crowd of 16,249. Therefore, the statement "the Princes Park venue had more crowd than the Junction Oval venue" is incorrect/false.
842	The statement "North Melbourne had the highest score out of all the away teams" can be supported by the information presented in the table. In the table, the away teams and their corresponding scores are as follows:- Melbourne: 14.14 (98)- North Melbourne: 17.19 (121)- Essendon: 12.9 (81)- Collingwood: 13.11 (89)- Carlton: 16.10 (106)- South Melbourne: 12.15 (87)As we can see, North Melbourne had the highest score among all the away teams, with a score of 17.19 (121). Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
843	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Fitzroy had a score of 15.7 (97) while Footscray had a score of 13.11 (89) in their respective matches played on 7 June 1975.Therefore, the statement "Fitzroy has a higher score than Footscray" is false as Footscray had a lower score.
844	Yes, the statement that "all the matches were on the same date" is supported by the information in the table. As we can see, all the matches were played on June 7, 1975, which is listed in the "date" column in all rows of the table. Therefore, we can conclude that all the matches were played on the same date.
845	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "kardinia park has less crowd than moorabbin oval" is supported. The table shows that the match between Geelong and Melbourne, which took place at Kardinia Park, had a crowd of 13328, while the match between St Kilda and North Melbourne, which took place at Moorabbin Oval, had a crowd of 17811. Therefore, Moorabbin Oval had a larger crowd than Kardinia Park during the 1975 VFL season.
846	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the Princes Park venue had just as much crowd as the Junction Oval venue" is refuted. The crowd recorded at Princes Park for the match between Hawthorn and Collingwood on June 7, 1975, was 23,830, while the crowd recorded at Junction Oval for the match between Fitzroy and Carlton on the same day was 16,249. Therefore, the two venues did not have the same amount of crowd.
847	Based on the information in the table, the statement "north melbourne had the second highest score out of all the away teams" is supported. In the third match listed in the table, North Melbourne scored 17.19 (121) against St Kilda on June 7, 1975. No other away team listed in the table scored higher than 121 in a single match during the 1975 VFL season. Therefore, North Melbourne had the second-highest score out of all the away teams in the table provided.
848	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. Fitzroy's score in the match listed in row 6 is 15.7 (97), which was lower than Hawthorn's score of 19.24 (138) in the match listed in row 5. Therefore, Fitzroy does not have a higher score than any of the other teams listed in the table.
849	Refuted. All the matches listed in the table took place on the same date - June 7, 1975.
850	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "Moorabbin Oval has less crowd than Kardinia Park" is refuted. Kardinia Park had a crowd of 13328 for the match between Geelong and Melbourne, whereas Moorabbin Oval had a crowd of 17811 for the match between St Kilda and North Melbourne. Therefore, Moorabbin Oval had a larger crowd attendance than Kardinia Park during the 1975 VFL season.
851	The statement seems to be supported by the data in the table. The sum of the "races" column from 1995 to 2008 is 190, which matches the total number of races mentioned in the statement. Therefore, it appears that Shane Hall did run a total of 190 races spanning from 1995 to 2008.
852	To calculate the average finish for Shane Hall between 1995-2008, we would first need to sum up his finishes from each season and divide by the number of seasons. Looking at the table, we can see that his finishes ranged from 24.0 to 43.0, with a total of 291.6.To calculate the average, we divide 291.6 by the total number of seasons, which is 14. Therefore, 291.6 / 14 = 20.83.Therefore, the statement "Shane Hall had an average finish of 31.39 between 1995 - 2008" is refuted by the data in the table. The actual average finish is 20.83.
853	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. As per the given table, Shane Hall ran the most number of races (75) on the Stegell Motorsports team, compared to any of his other teams.
854	That statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the "top 5" and "top 10" columns in the table, we can see that Shane Hall had:- 0 top 5 placements (he never finished a race higher than 5th)- 12 top 10 placementsTherefore, it can be concluded that Shane Hall had more top 10 placements than top 5 placements, which supports the statement given.
855	The statement "in the year 2000 Shane Hall DNF half of his races" is supported by the table. As per the table, in the year 2000, Shane Hall participated in 2 races and had a DNF (Did Not Finish) in one of them. Therefore, he DNF'd half of his races that year.
856	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. The table shows that Shane Hall ran a total of 195 races between the years of 1995 to 2008.
857	To check whether the statement "Shane Hall had an average finish of 33.39 between 1995-2008" is supported or refuted by the table, you can calculate his average finish by adding up all his finishes from 1995-2008 and dividing by the total number of races he competed in during that time period. Using the data in the table, the total sum of finishes for Shane Hall between 1995-2008 is 429.6, which is the sum of his finishes in each race listed in the table. Dividing this figure by the total number of races he competed in during this time period, which is 161 (the sum of the "races" column in the table), gives an average finish of 2.67, not 33.39.Therefore, the statement "Shane Hall had an average finish of 33.39 between 1995-2008" is refuted by the information in the given table.
858	According to the table, Shane Hall ran a total of 33 races with Hensley Racing in 2001, which was the most number of races he ran with any particular team. Therefore, the statement "Shane Hall ran more races with Hensley Racing than any of his other teams" is supported by the information presented in the table.
859	The statement cannot be supported by the information in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Shane Hall has only placed in the top 5 once in his entire career (in 1999), while he has placed in the top 10 a total of 6 times. This means that Shane Hall has placed in the top 10 more times than he has placed in the top 5, and thus the statement is refuted by the table.
860	The statement you provided, "in the year 2001 shane hall had dnf half his races," is supported by the table. In 2001, Shane Hall competed in 33 races, and had a total of six DNF (did not finish) results, which is exactly half of his races.
861	Refuted. The information in the table shows that irregular galaxy (example: row 2) has an apparent magnitude of 14.0, while spiral galaxy (example: rows 3 and 5) has an apparent magnitude of 8.7 and 11.9 respectively. This means that, on average, irregular galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 2.85 less than spiral galaxy, rather than 2.1 more as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
862	Refuted. The table shows that the spiral galaxy with NGC number 5457 has an apparent magnitude of 8.7, which is lower (brighter) than the other galaxies and the globular cluster in the table. This means that spiral galaxies do not necessarily have the least apparent magnitude.
863	Based on the provided table, the statement that "irregular galaxy has two ngc numbers in the list" is supported. As shown in the table, there are two rows that correspond to irregular galaxies, and each row contains an NGC number: row 1 for NGC 5408 and row 6 for NGC 5477. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the provided table.
864	The statement "globular cluster has less apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy" is supported by the table. Looking at row 4, we can see that NGC 5466 is a "globular cluster" with an apparent magnitude of "10.5". Meanwhile, row 1 and row 6 show us that NGC 5408 and NGC 5477 are "irregular galaxies" with apparent magnitudes of "14.0" and "14.5", respectively. Therefore, we can see that the globular cluster NGC 5466 has a lower (i.e. less bright, or less intense) apparent magnitude than both of the irregular galaxies listed in the table, which supports the statement that you provided.
865	I have reviewed the information presented in the table. Based on the data provided, the statement that "globular cluster has the second highest declination (j2000) in the list" is not supported by the table. While the table does include a row for a globular cluster (NGC 5466), its declination of degree32′04″ places it lower on the list (further away from the north celestial pole) than several other objects in the table. Specifically, the following objects have higher declinations than NGC 5466: - NGC 5408 (declination of degree22′44″)- NGC 5457 (declination of degree20′53″)- NGC 5474 (declination of degree39′45″)- NGC 5477 (declination of degree27′40″)Therefore, the statement that the globular cluster has the second-highest declination in the list is refuted by the information presented in the table.
866	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table. Firstly, the table does not include any entries for "globular galaxy," only for "globular cluster."Furthermore, the comparison between the apparent magnitudes of irregular galaxies and globular clusters cannot be made based on the given data, as there is only one entry for each object type in the table, each with its own distinct apparent magnitude. Therefore, the statement cannot be evaluated based on the information presented in the table.
867	Refuted. The statement "spiral galaxy have the most apparent magnitude" is refuted by the information in the table. The spiral galaxy with the highest apparent magnitude listed in the table is row 5 (NGC 5474) with a magnitude of 11.9. However, the irregular galaxy listed in row 1 (NGC 5408) has an apparent magnitude of 14.0, which is higher than the apparent magnitude of any of the spiral galaxies listed. Therefore, based on the data in the table, it can be concluded that the statement "spiral galaxy have the most apparent magnitude" is not supported.
868	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that there are two objects listed as "spiral galaxy": NGC 5457 and NGC 5474, both of which are in the list of NGC objects with numbers between 5001 and 6000. Therefore, we can say that the statement "spiral galaxy has two NGC numbers in the list" is supported by the information presented in the table.
869	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Looking at rows 2 and 4 of the table, we can see that NGC 5457 is an irregular galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 8.7, while NGC 5466 is a globular cluster with an apparent magnitude of 10.5. This indicates that the globular cluster (NGC 5466) has a higher apparent magnitude than the irregular galaxy (NGC 5457), as stated in the statement.
870	The statement is refuted by the table. While it is true that there is a spiral galaxy listed in the table, with an NGC number of 5457, it does not have the second highest declination (j2000) in the list. The declination of this spiral galaxy is listed as "degree20′53″", which is lower than the declinations of three other objects in the list:  "degree22′44″" for the irregular galaxy with NGC number 5408, "degree32′04″" for the globular cluster with NGC number 5466, and "degree39′45″" for the spiral galaxy with NGC number 5474. Therefore, the statement that the spiral galaxy has the second highest declination (j2000) in the list is refuted by the information presented in the table.
871	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement that "during the 1961 VFL season, MCG venue recorded the highest crowd participation" is supported. The table shows that the match between Melbourne and Carlton on 3 June 1961, which was played at MCG, had a crowd of 49,678, which is the highest crowd attendance recorded in the table.
872	Based on the table provided, the statement "Kardinia Park is one of the six venues that were put to use on 3 June 1961" is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the match between Geelong and Footscray was played at Kardinia Park on 3 June 1961, along with five other matches played at different venues.
873	The statement is supported by the table.According to the table, North Melbourne was the home team in their match against St Kilda and they recorded a home score of 9.14 (68). South Melbourne was also a home team in their match against Fitzroy and their home score was recorded as 7.8 (50). Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the information presented in the table.
874	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the game between South Melbourne and Fitzroy was held at Lake Oval and had a crowd of 14,500, while the game between Hawthorn and Richmond was held at Glenferrie Oval and had a crowd of 15,000. Therefore, the crowd participation at Lake Oval was lower than that of Glenferrie Oval during the 1961 VFL season.
875	I apologize, but the statement you provided is actually refuted by the table. The table shows that the Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 13,000, while the Glenferrie Oval had a crowd of 15,000. Therefore, the Glenferrie Oval actually recorded 2,000 more crowd participants than the Arden Street Oval.
876	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table for Round 8 of the 1961 VFL season, the highest crowd participation was recorded at the Melbourne vs Carlton match played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on June 3, 1961, with a crowd of 49,678. The match played at Lake Oval between South Melbourne and Fitzroy attracted a crowd of 14,500, which is comparatively lower than the Melbourne vs Carlton match. Therefore, the statement that "during the 1961 VFL season, Lake Oval venue recorded the highest crowd participation" is refuted by the table.
877	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "kardinia park is one of the four venues that were put to use on 3 June 1961" is supported. The table shows that the Geelong Football Club played at Kardinia Park on 3 June 1961, along with three other matches that were played at different venues on the same day. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
878	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is incorrect as it does not match the information in the table. The table shows that on June 3, 1961, North Melbourne played against St Kilda at Arden Street Oval and scored 9.14 (68) as the home team. Meanwhile, South Melbourne played against Fitzroy at Lake Oval and scored 7.8 (50) as the home team. Therefore, the statement you provided is refuted by the information in the table.
879	The statement can be supported by the table. Looking at the "crowd" column in the table, we can see that the game between South Melbourne and Fitzroy held at Lake Oval on June 3, 1961, had a crowd of 14,500 people. On the other hand, the game between Hawthorn and Richmond held at Glenferrie Oval on the same day had a crowd of 15,000 people. Therefore, the statement that Lake Oval venue recorded a higher crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue could be refuted.
880	I'm sorry, but the statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that on June 3, 1961, Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 13,000 for the North Melbourne vs. St Kilda game, while Glenferrie Oval had a crowd of 15,000 for the Hawthorn vs. Richmond game. Hence, Glenferrie Oval had only 2000 more crowd participants than Arden Street Oval, not 5000.
881	The statement "there are only two highest ranks listed in the table" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows four different highest ranks held by the sumo wrestlers listed - sekiwake, ōzeki, and two wrestlers held these two highest ranks. Therefore, there are four different highest ranks listed in the table, not just two.
882	The statement "takamiyama had the longest time range between his first and last record, 13 years" is supported by the information in the table. Takamiyama's first record was in November 1969, and his last record was in September 1982, which is a difference of 13 years. Therefore, the table shows that Takamiyama had the longest time range between his first and last record, which matches the statement.
883	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The only total that appears more than two times in the table is 22, and it appears three times (in rows 11, 12, and 13). The rest of the totals appear two times or less, which confirms that the statement is correct.
884	The statement appears to be supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the sumo wrestler Hasegawa recorded a total of 30 wins between November 1965 and September 1974, which indicates that the first record was indeed recorded in November of 1965.
885	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not support the statement that "the last record for both the highest totalling name and the lowest totalling name were recorded in the month of September." While it is true that Kotonishiki, who holds the highest record on the table with 34 victories, achieved his last victory in September 1999, it is not true that the lowest record holder achieved their last victory in September. Daikirin, who has the lowest record on the table with 22 victories, achieved his last victory in September 1970. However, Hasegawa, who is the fourth-highest record holder on the table with 30 victories, achieved his last victory in September 1974, which is after Daikirin. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table presented.
886	The statement is refuted by the data presented in the table. Although three out of the 13 wrestlers in the table reached the rank of ōzeki, there are actually four ranks listed in the table: sekiwake, ōzeki, and two yokozuna holders (not explicitly stated in the table, but implied by having the highest total number of wins). So, in fact, there are four highest ranks listed in the table.
887	The statement, "takamiyama had the shortest time range between his first and last record , 13 years", is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Takamiyama had his first sumo record in November 1969, and his last record in September 1982, which is a total of 13 years between the two dates. Thus, the statement is supported by the table.
888	The statement is supported by the information in the table. There is only one total that appears more than two times in the table, and it is 31. The sumo wrestlers Musōyama and Hasegawa both have a total of 31 wins recorded in the table. All other totals listed in the table appear two times or fewer. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
889	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the first record was recorded after November 1965" is refuted. This is because the wrestler Hasegawa, who is included in the table, has a total of 30 records and his first record was recorded in November 1965, which was the earliest recorded record in the table.
890	The statement can be refuted by the information presented in the table. While it is true that some of the record holders in the table have had records made in May, there is no indication that the last record for the highest totalling name and the lowest totalling name were recorded in the month of May. For example, the highest totalling name in the table is Kotonishiki with a total of 34, and his last record was made in September 1999. Similarly, the lowest totalling name in the table is Daikirin with a total of 22, and his last record was made in September 1970. Therefore, the statement that the last record for both the highest totalling name and the lowest totalling name were recorded in the month of May is not supported by the information in the table.
891	Based on the table provided, the statement appears to be supported. The table includes equestrian events and their medalists from every year except for 1990, which suggests that equestrian at the Asian Games did not happen during that year. The events took place every four years from 1982 to 2010 as listed in the table.
892	Based on the table you provided, the statement "equestrian at the Asian Games has been located in a different city every year that it occurred" is supported. The table shows that equestrian events were held in different cities in each edition of the Asian Games, including New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, and Guangzhou, respectively. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
893	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the year 1982 at New Delhi, Nadia Al-Moutawakel won the gold medal in equestrian, while Jamila Al-Moutawakel won the silver medal, and Bariaa Salem Al-Sabbah won the bronze medal. Therefore, Nadia Al-Moutawakel was indeed the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games, and the table confirms this.
894	That statement is supported by the information presented in the table. If you look at the "Gold" column, you can see that a different athlete won the gold medal in each year from 1982 to 2022. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
895	The statement appears to be partially supported by the table. The table shows that equestrian events were held at the Asian Games in Seoul in 1986 and in Doha in 2006, both of which were hosted by South Korea. However, the statement also mentions that Incheon hosted equestrian events, but this is not reflected in the table provided. So, while the table supports the part of the statement that says South Korea hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games in Seoul and Doha, it does not fully support the statement since it does not provide information about Incheon hosting equestrian events.
896	The statement is supported by the table. The table lists the results of the equestrian events at the Asian Games from 1982 to 2010, and shows that the events occurred at regular intervals of four years. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
897	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Equestrian events at the Asian Games have been held in different cities every year except for two instances: 1994, when the event was held in Hiroshima, and 1998, when it was held in Bangkok. The rest of the years listed in the table have different locations, meaning the statement is true.
898	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Nadia al - Moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games in 1982 held in New Delhi, and she won the silver medal in another year. Jamila al - Moutawaa, who won the silver in 1982, was likely her sister.
899	The statement is supported by the table. If we look at the table, the gold medalist in the equestrian event is different in every year except for 1994 and 1998. In 1994 and 1998, Konoshin Kuwahara won the gold medal in Hiroshima, and Jin Kanno won the gold medal in Bangkok, respectively. In all other years (1982, 1986, 2002, 2006, and 2010), a different athlete won the gold medal in the equestrian event at the Asian Games. Therefore, based on the information presented in the table, the statement is true.
900	The statement "South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time, in Seoul two times" is supported by the table. The table shows that the equestrian event was held twice in Seoul - once in 1986 and another time in an unspecified year. This means that South Korea is the only country to have hosted the equestrian event more than once.
901	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the San Francisco 49ers won 8 games during the 1947 season, as indicated by the number of victories (W) in the "Result" column and the record in the "Record" column.
902	The statement is supported by the table. The first row of the table indicates that the 49ers' first opponent of the 1947 season was the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the 49ers won the game with a score of 23-7.
903	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the first row shows the information about the first game of the season, which was played on August 31, 1947, against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The table also shows that the game resulted in a win for the San Francisco 49ers, with a score of 23-7. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
904	The statement "the 49ers tied two out of fourteen games in the 1947 season" is supported by the table. As shown in row 6 and row 15, the 49ers tied the Baltimore Colts and the Buffalo Bills, respectively. The table shows that the 49ers played a total of 14 games in the 1947 season, and the record column indicates two ties, which confirms the statement.
905	The statement is supported by the table. As we can see from row 2, San Francisco 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons on September 7, 1947, and won with a score of 17-14. Similarly, in row 9, we see that the 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons again on November 2, 1947, and won with a score of 26-16. Therefore, since the 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons two times during the 1947 season, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
906	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the 49ers played 14 games in the 1947 season, and their record was 8-4-2. They won eight games, lost four games, and tied two games. Therefore, the statement "the 49ers lost eight of the games in the 1947 season" is incorrect as the team lost only four of the games.
907	Refuted. According to the table, the last opponent of the 49ers during the 1947 season was the Buffalo Bills, not the Brooklyn Dodgers. They played against the Buffalo Bills on December 7, 1947, and the result was a tie with a score of 21-21.
908	The statement "August 31st, 1947 was the date of the last game of the season" is refuted by the table. The table shows that there were 14 games played during the season, with the last game being played on December 7th, 1947, against the Buffalo Bills. Therefore, August 31st, 1947, was not the date of the last game of the season, but rather the first game of the season against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
909	The statement "the 49ers lost two out of fourteen games in the 1947 season" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers had a total of four losses in the 1947 season. They lost to the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Browns twice, and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.
910	The statement that "the 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons one time in the 1947 season" is refuted by the table you provided. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons on two occasions during the 1947 season. The 49ers won both matches against the Los Angeles Dons, with scores of 17-14 and 26-16, respectively. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
911	That statement is not supported by the table. While Yani Tseng won the Women's British Open in 2010 (278 strokes) and 2008 (270 strokes), which are both low scores, there are other champions on the list with lower scores. For example, Karen Stupples won the event in 2004 with a score of 269, Jeong Jang won in 2005 with a score of 272, and Yani Tseng won in 2011 with a score of 277. Annika Sörenstam won in 2003 with a score of 278, but several other champions on the list also won with a score below 278. Therefore, the statement that "Annika Sörenstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest number of strokes" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
912	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In 2008, Yani Tseng finished as the runner-up with a score of 270, (-18), three strokes behind the eventual winner, Jiyai Shin.In 2010 and 2011, Yani Tseng won the Women's British Open Championship. She won with a score of 277, (-11) in 2010, defeating Katherine Hull by one stroke. She won with a score of 272, (-16) in 2011, defeating Brittany Lang by four strokes.
913	The statement is supported by the table. In 2001, Se Ri Pak from South Korea was the champion of Women's British Open with a score of 277 and a to-par score of -11. Two years later, in 2003, she came in second place, losing to Annika Sorenstam from Sweden by one stroke with a score of 279 and a to-par score of -9. Therefore, Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001 and came in second place two years after.
914	The statement that "Jiyai Shin became champion by beating Inbee Park in the 2012 open with 9 strokes" is supported by the table. According to row 3 of the table, Jiyai Shin from South Korea won the 2012 Women's British Open held at Royal Liverpool Golf Club with a score of 279, nine strokes ahead of the runner-up Inbee Park from South Korea who scored 288.
915	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that in 2012, Jiyai Shin won £428,650 as the winner's share, while Yani Tseng won £392,133 as the winner's share in 2011. The difference between the two amounts is £36,517, which is the opposite of what the statement claims. Therefore, the statement "in 2012, Jiyal Shin earned £36,517 more than Yani Tseng in 2011" is not supported by the information in the table.
916	The statement is supported by the table as Annika Sörenstam from Sweden won the Women's British Open in the year 2003 with a score of 278, which is the lowest number of strokes in the entire table. Similarly, Catriona Matthew from Scotland won the tournament in the year 2009 with a score of 285, which is also the lowest score of all the winners mentioned in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information provided in the table.
917	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that Jiyai Shin of South Korea was the champion in 2008, winning with a score of 270 and a margin of victory of 3 strokes. Additionally, Yani Tseng of Taiwan won the championship in both 2010 and 2011, with scores of 277 and 272 and margin of victory of 1 and 4 strokes respectively. While Karrie Webb from Australia did participate in the championships in 2008, her position was not as the runner-up, as she did not finish in the top 10.
918	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Se Ri Pak from South Korea won the Women's British Open in 2001 with a score of 277, which was 11 under par. Then, in 2003, she finished in second place, just one stroke behind the champion Annika Sörenstam. This means that Se Ri Pak was indeed the champion in 2001 and then came in second place two years after.
919	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is incorrect. Jiyai Shin did win the Women's British Open in 2008 and 2012, but she did not win in 2010. Yani Tseng was the champion in the 2010 Women's British Open, beating Katherine Hull by one stroke. Additionally, the margin of victory in Jiyai Shin's 2012 win was not 9 strokes, but rather 9 strokes lower than the runner-up, Inbee Park. Therefore, the statement "Jiyal Shin became champion by beating Inbee Park in the 2010 Open with 9 strokes" is refuted by the table.
920	The statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the table since it does not provide any information about the prize money earned by Jiyai Shin or Yani Tseng in the Women's British Open in 2011 or 2012. The table only shows the dates, venues, champions, scores, and prize money each year from 2001 to 2013.
921	The statement is supported by the table. If you add up the number of games won and lost by the Dolphins during the regular season (ignoring the results of any playoff games), you'll see that they won 12 games and lost 4. Therefore, the statement that "the dolphins finished the regular season with a 12 - 4 record" is true according to the table.
922	Based on the information given in the table, the statement "the dolphins' defense recorded two shutouts during the season" is supported. In week 1, the Miami Dolphins played against the Buffalo Bills and won with a score of 12-0, indicating that the defense prevented the opposing team from scoring any points. In week 12, the Miami Dolphins played against the Baltimore Colts and won with a score of 37-0, which also indicates that the defense did not allow the opposition to score any points. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
923	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the Miami Dolphins won nine out of their final ten games in the 1983 season, with only one loss. Rows 2,4,7-11,12,13,15,16 all indicate a win for the Dolphins. The only loss in their final ten games was in week 6 against the Buffalo Bills, as indicated in Row 6 of the table. Therefore, the statement "9 of the dolphins final 10 games were victories" is supported by the table.
924	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the Dolphins scored more than 38 points in three different games during the 1983 season: - Week 3 against the Los Angeles Raiders, the Dolphins scored 14 points- Week 6 against the Buffalo Bills, the Dolphins scored 35 points- Week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Dolphins scored 38 points Therefore, the statement "the most points scored by the dolphins in a game was 38" is not supported by the information in the table.
925	The statement is supported by the table. The lowest attendance figure for a game during the 1983 Miami Dolphins season was indeed 32,343, which was recorded during the Week 8 game against the Baltimore Colts.
926	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the Dolphins' defense recorded three shutouts during the 1983 season" is not supported. The table shows the results of each game played during the season, including the opponent and the result, but none of the games resulted in a shutout victory for the Dolphins. The closest to a shutout victory was a 37-0 win against the Baltimore Colts in Week 12.
927	This statement is false. Although the Miami Dolphins had a successful 1983 season, winning the AFC East division with a record of 12 wins and 4 losses, they did not win their final 10 games. From the table provided, we can see that they lost two games during this period. They lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6, and to the New England Patriots in Week 11. Therefore, the statement that "the Dolphins' final 10 games were victories" is refuted by the table.
928	This statement is both supported and refuted by the information in the table. The Dolphins scored 34 points or more in three games during the 1983 season - Week 2 against the New England Patriots (won 34-24), Week 7 against the New York Jets (won 32-14), and Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons (won 31-24). Therefore, the statement is supported.However, in Week 1 against the Buffalo Bills, the Dolphins won 12-0, which means they scored 12 points and not 34. Therefore, the statement is also refuted.In conclusion, the statement "the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game was 34 points" is PARTIALLY supported and PARTIALLY refuted by the information in the table.
929	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the attendance for the Dolphins game against the Houston Oilers on December 4, 1983, was 39,434, which is the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins' game.
930	The statement "during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29" is supported by the table. On February 27, the Minnesota Wild had a score of 3-2 in their game against Tampa Bay, and on February 29, they also had a score of 3-2 in their game against Florida. Both rows in the table show a score of 3-2 for the Minnesota Wild.
931	The statement is supported by the table. On February 10, 2008, the Minnesota Wild beat the St. Louis Blues by a score of 2-1, as listed in row 6 of the table. On February 24, 2008, the Minnesota Wild lost to the Calgary Flames by a score of 2-1, as listed in row 12 of the table. Therefore, the statement that "during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score on February 10 and February 24 was 2-1" is correct according to the table provided.
932	According to the table, the match on February 12 between the Wild and the Oilers was won by the Oilers with a score of 4-2, with Harding as the goaltender. The decision was recorded as a loss for the Wild.On the other hand, the match on February 20 between the Wild and the Blackhawks was won by the Blackhawks with a score of 3-0, again with Harding as the goaltender. The decision was recorded as a loss for the Wild.So, the statement "during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, the match on February 12 and February 20 both had the same decision" is supported by the table, as both matches resulted in a loss for the Wild, even though they had different opponents.
933	To verify the statement, we need to count the number of home games and away games played by Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season. According to the table provided, Minnesota Wild played a total of 41 games at home and 41 games away, which means they played an equal number of home and away games. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table, as Minnesota Wild played the same number of home and away games during the 2007-08 season.
934	Based on the table you provided, the statement "during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, the decision was backstrom eleven times more than it was harding" is supported. Backstrom had a decision (a win or a loss) in 10 of the 13 games listed, while Harding had a decision in only 3 of the games. Therefore, Backstrom had a decision 7 more times than Harding did, which is close to the 11 times mentioned in the statement.
935	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, Minnesota won both games mentioned in the statement. On February 27, Minnesota defeated Tampa Bay with a score of 3-2, and on February 29, Minnesota defeated Florida with a score of 3-2. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
936	To check if the statement "during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, the difference in the score on February 10 and February 24 was more than 2" is supported or refuted by the table provided, we need to look for the scores of the games played on February 10 and February 24:- On February 10, Minnesota won against St. Louis by a score of 2-1 with Josh Harding in goal.- On February 24, Minnesota lost to Calgary by a score of 2-1 with Niklas Backstrom in goal.The difference in the score for these two games is exactly 1, not more than 2. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
937	According to the table, the match on February 12th (row 6) had a score of 2-4, and the match on February 20th (row 11) had a score of 0-3. Therefore, the statement that "during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota wild season, the match on February 12th and February 20th both had the same score" is refuted by the information in the table.
938	Based on the table provided, it is supported that during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, they played more games at home than away. Out of the 14 games listed in the table, 8 of them were played at home and 6 were played away. This shows that Minnesota played more games at home than away during that particular season.
939	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, the decision was harding more times than it was backstrom" is refuted. The table shows that Backstrom had the decision (meaning he was the winning goaltender) in 9 of the 13 games listed, while Harding had the decision in only 4 of the games. Therefore, Backstrom had the decision more times than Harding during the 2007-08 season.
940	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, the Detroit Lions won six games and lost eight during the 1976 season. This is confirmed by rows 2, 5, 7, 8, 11, and 12 where the Lions won against the Atlanta Falcons, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers, Chicago Bears, and Buffalo Bills respectively, and lost against the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings (twice), Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins, New Orleans Saints, and the Los Angeles Rams. Therefore, the statement that the Lions finished with a record of 6 wins and 8 losses is supported by the information presented in the table.
941	That statement is supported by the information in the table. The lowest attendance figure for a 1976 Detroit Lions game was 42,048, which occurred during the game against the New Orleans Saints on November 14th, 1976.
942	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Detroit Lions played the Minnesota Vikings twice during the 1976 season (in weeks 3 and 9). The Lions lost to the Vikings in both games, with scores of 10-9 and 31-23, respectively. Therefore, the statement that "the Minnesota Vikings defeated the Lions in both games they played" is true based on the information provided in the table.
943	The statement "the most points scored by the lions in a single game was 41" is supported by the information in the table. In row 7 of the table, it shows that on October 24, 1976, the Lions played against the Seattle Seahawks and won with a score of 41-14. This is the highest number of points scored by the Lions in a single game, as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
944	This statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 8, we can see that the Lions played against the Green Bay Packers on October 31, 1976, and won the game with a score of 27-6. This means that the Packers scored only 6 points, which is indeed the lowest amount of points they scored against the Lions during the 1976 season as shown in the table. Therefore, the statement "the packers scored the least amount of points (6) in a game versus the lions" is supported by the table.
945	The statement is refuted by the table as the Lions finished the 1976 season with a record of 6 wins and 8 losses. The table shows that they won six games, against the Atlanta Falcons, the New England Patriots, the Seattle Seahawks, the Green Bay Packers, the Chicago Bears, and the Buffalo Bills, and lost eight games against the Chicago Bears, the Minnesota Vikings, the Green Bay Packers, the Washington Redskins, the Minnesota Vikings, the New Orleans Saints, the New York Giants, and the Los Angeles Rams.
946	The statement "the highest attendance figure for a game was 42048" is supported by the table. According to row 10, the game against the New Orleans Saints on November 14, 1976, had an attendance of 42,048, which is indeed the highest attendance figure for a game listed in the table.
947	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the chicago bears defeated the lions in both games they played" is supported. The first game between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears on Week 1 resulted in a 10 - 3 loss for the Lions, as indicated in row 2 of the table. The second game between the two teams on Week 11 resulted in a 14 - 10 win for the Lions, as indicated in row 11 of the table. Therefore, it can be seen that the Bears won the first game, but the Lions won the second game.
948	The statement is refuted by the information given in the table. According to the table, the most points scored by the Lions in a single game during the 1976 season was 41, during their 41-14 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.
949	The statement "the packers scored the highest amount of points (6) in a game versus the lions" is refuted by the table. While the Packers did win two games against the Lions during the 1976 season, their highest point total in either game was 24 points (Week 4). They scored 6 points in their Week 8 match but that game was against the San Francisco 49ers, not the Detroit Lions.
950	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in four games: the second game against Cincinnati on September 27th (result: Win, Wildcats points: 20, opponents' points: 0), the third game against Xavier on October 4th (result: Win, Wildcats points: 20, opponents' points: 7), the fourth game against #9 Georgia on October 11th (result: Win, Wildcats points: 26, opponents' points: 0), and the fifth game against #10 Vanderbilt on October 18th (result: Win, Wildcats points: 14, opponents' points: 0).
951	The statement "the wildcats never scored more than 7 in any game they lost" is supported by the information in the table. As we can see, there were two games that the Wildcats lost - on September 20 against Ole Miss and on November 1 against 18 Alabama. In both those games, the Wildcats scored only 7 points, which is less than or equal to the maximum points they scored in any other game they lost. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
952	The statement: "the wildcats lost one game in September and two games in November" is supported by the information in the table. In September, the Wildcats played one game against Ole Miss and lost with a score of 7-14. Thus, they lost one game in September.In November, the Wildcats played three games against Alabama, West Virginia, and Tennessee. They won against West Virginia and Evansville, but they lost against Alabama and Tennessee, which confirms that their statement of losing two games in November. Therefore, the information presented in the table supports the statement that "the wildcats lost one game in September and two games in November".
953	The statement "the wildcats played two games in September, four games in October, and four games in November" is supported by the table. As per the table, the Wildcats played one game in September, four games in October, and five games in November. Therefore, they played four games in October and four games in November, which matches the statement.
954	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The table shows that in the game against Evansville, the Wildcats outscored their opponent by 36 points with a final score of 36-0. This is the largest difference in points between the Wildcats and any of their opponents in the 1947 season according to the table.
955	The statement, "the wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in ten games," is refuted by the information presented in the table. As we can see from the table, the Wildcats played ten games during the 1947 season and won seven of them. However, they only managed to keep their opponents scoreless in three games (against Cincinnati, Xavier, and Vanderbilt). In the remaining seven games, the opposing teams were able to score against them, with losses to Ole Miss, Alabama, and Tennessee, and close wins over Michigan State and West Virginia. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
956	The statement "the wildcats never scored more than 7 points in any game they won" is refuted by the information in the table. Kentucky scored more than 7 points in several games that they won: - In game 2 against Cincinnati, they scored 20 points and won. - In game 3 against Xavier, they scored 20 points and won. - In game 4 against Georgia, they scored 26 points and won. - In game 5 against Vanderbilt, they scored 14 points and won. - In game 6 against Michigan State, they scored 7 points and won. - In game 8 against West Virginia, they scored 15 points and won. - In game 9 against Evansville, they scored 36 points and won.Therefore, the statement is refuted.
957	The statement "the wildcats lost one game in November and two games in September" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the Wildcats lost their first game on September 20th against Ole Miss and their last game on November 22nd against Tennessee. Therefore, they lost one game in November.Also, it shows that they won one game and lost one game in September. The Wildcats' record after the first game was 0-1, and after the second game, it was 1-1.
958	Based on the table provided, the statement "the wildcats played four games in September, two games in October, and two games in November" is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the Wildcats played four games in September, starting with their first game on September 20 against Ole Miss and ending on September 27 with a game against Cincinnati. The table shows that the Wildcats played two games in October, starting with a game against Xavier on October 4 and ending on October 25 with a game against Michigan State University. Finally, the table shows that the Wildcats played two games in November, with their last game being against Tennessee on November 22. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
959	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, the Wildcats had their biggest victory over Georgia on October 11th, 1947, where they outscored their opponent by 26 points with a final score of 26-0. Thus, the statement "the most the wildcats outscored an opponent is by 26 points" is true and supported by the information presented in the table.
960	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Ford engine cars were the most common in the race, with six out of the top ten finishers being powered by a Ford engine, there were also cars powered by BRM, Alfa Romeo, and Matra engines in the race. The March-Alfa Romeo car driven by Andrea de Adamich did finish last, but it was one of only two Alfa Romeo-powered cars in the race, while a Matra-powered car (driven by Chris Amon) finished sixth. Therefore, the statement that "there are more Fords than any other with Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least" is not fully supported by the information in the table.
961	Based on the given table for the 1971 South African Grand Prix, the statement "Oh the issue affecting time engine trouble is the most common" cannot be supported or refuted as there is no distinct pattern that indicates engine trouble being the most common reason for retirement. The causes of retirement include engine trouble, physical reasons, gearbox issues, fuel leak, and suspension issues, among others. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that engine trouble was the most common issue.
962	The statement that "Alex Soler-Roig has the highest position at 25 on the grid, following Howden Ganley at 24, with Jackie Stewart in the 1st position" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 26 shows Alex Soler-Roig's qualifying position as 25 on the grid, which is the highest of all the drivers listed in the table. Meanwhile, Howden Ganley's position is shown in row 18 as 24th on the grid, and Jackie Stewart is listed in row 3 as starting from the first position.
963	The first part of the statement that there is a four way tie for the most laps at 79 is supported by the table as there are four drivers - Mario Andretti, Jackie Stewart, Clay Regazzoni, and Reine Wisell - who completed 79 laps. However, the second part of the statement that there is a two way tie for the least amount of laps at 5 is not supported as there is only one driver listed with 5 laps completed, which is Jo Bonnier in a McLaren-Ford who retired due to suspension issues.
964	The statement seems to be refuted by the table as there are several drivers listed below 75 laps who have a reason for retiring and not finishing the race, which is listed in the "time / retired" column. For example, Peter Gethin, who is listed in row 24, completed only 7 laps before retiring due to a fuel leak. Similarly, Jo Bonnier (row 25), Alex Soler-Roig (row 26), and Howden Ganley (row 18) also retired before completing 75 laps due to suspension, engine, and physical issues, respectively. Therefore, the statement that any driver below 75 laps had some sort of trouble is not supported by the table.
965	That statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, there is only one BRM entered in the 1971 South African Grand Prix, and it was driven by Howden Ganley. So there are only two teams with one car each: BRM and McLaren. Meanwhile, Alfa Romeo and Matra are not represented in the race, so they cannot tie in any way. Therefore, the statement "there are more BRM than any other with Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least" is not true based on the information provided in the table.
966	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table as it does not provide any information about the issues affecting the drivers' times or the frequency of issues. The table only provides information about the drivers, constructors, laps completed, time or reason for retiring, and the starting grid position. The table does not provide any information on the issues affecting the drivers' times or the number of drivers facing suspension trouble.
967	The statement you provided is incorrect or unclear because the table only provides information about the finishing positions of the drivers in the 1971 South African Grand Prix, and not their starting positions. The table does not have any information or data regarding the starting positions of the drivers, therefore it's not possible to determine if John Love had the highest position of 25th on the grid or if Dave Charlton was in the 1st position. So, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
968	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the most laps completed by a driver was 79, which was achieved by several drivers including Mario Andretti, Jackie Stewart, Clay Regazzoni, and others. The least amount of laps completed by a driver in the race was 5, which was achieved by two drivers: Jo Bonnier and Alex Soler-Roig. Therefore, there is no four-way tie for the most laps completed at 75, nor a two-way tie for the least amount of laps at 7.
969	I'm sorry, but the statement "any driver above 75 laps care trouble of some kind thus no time listed" cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. The table only provides information about the number of laps completed, as well as the time or reason for retirement for each driver, but it doesn't mention anything about drivers above 75 laps having trouble. Additionally, all drivers in the table have times listed, even if they didn't complete all the laps.
970	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that "Team Brazil" is located in South America and is the only football club on the table associated with this continent.
971	The statement "team Australia is the only football club located in Oceania" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per row 14, "Team Australia" is listed as the only football club belonging to Oceania, while all the other football clubs belong to Europe, Asia, South America or have no associated continent listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
972	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "Beijing Guoan" is listed as number 12 and 24 (in 2010) and is associated with "Beijing Guoan FC". The table shows that "Beijing Guoan" participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons of Superleague Formula. Therefore, the statement that "Beijing Guoan is one of the two football clubs in Asia, and participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons" is supported by the information presented in the table.
973	The statement is supported by the table. Both "AC Sparta Prague" and "Team Netherlands" are listed under the "Europe" column in the table.
974	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "team brazil," "team australia," and "team england" are all listed as football clubs that participated in the 2011 season, with the respective racing drivers Antônio Pizzonia, John Martin, and Craig Dolby. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
975	The statement "team Brazil is the only football club located on the European continent" is refuted by the table. The table shows that team Brazil is located in South America, not Europe, and therefore, it cannot be the only football club located on the European continent.
976	The statement "Japan is the only football club located in Oceania" is not supported by the information in the table. There are two rows in the table that mention teams based in Oceania - "Team New Zealand" and "Team Australia". Both of these teams are listed as having participated in the 2011 season of the Superleague Formula championship. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are at least two football clubs located in Oceania, and the statement is not accurate based on the information in the table.
977	The statement you provided is not supported by the table. According to the table, FC Basel 1893 is a football club located in Europe and participated in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons. It is not one of the two football clubs in Asia.
978	The statement "ac sparta prague and team netherlands are both located on the asian continent" is refuted by the table. According to the table, AC Sparta Prague and Team Netherlands are both located in Europe, not Asia.
979	According to the table, the statement is refuted. Team Brazil, Team Australia, and Team England do not appear in the list of clubs that participated in the 2008 season. The table shows that AC Milan, RSC Anderlecht, FC Basel 1893, and Beijing Guoan were the clubs that participated in the 2008 season.
980	The statement is supported by the table. As per Row 16, the head coach of Sporting CP was José Peseiro, and as per Row 17, the head coach of Rio Ave was Carlos Brito. Therefore, the statement is correct.
981	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Belenenses, which finished 15th in the Liga in the 2003-04 season, played their home games at Estádio do Restelo, while Académica de Coimbra, which finished 13th in the Liga in the same season, played their home games at Estádio Cidade de Coimbra.
982	The statement "José Couceiro was the head coach in Setúbal, and it was Manuel Machado in Guimarães" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, José Couceiro was the head coach of Vitória de Setúbal, while Manuel Machado was the head coach of Vitória de Guimarães.
983	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Porto finished 1st in the 2003-2004 season of the Primeira Liga, followed by Benfica, who finished 2nd.
984	The statement "clubs Belenenses, Benfica and Sporting CP have Lisbon as the city" is supported by the information in the table. As we can see in rows 3, 4, and 16, the clubs Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP, respectively, have Lisbon as the city where their home stadium is located.
985	I'm sorry, but that statement is actually incorrect. Based on the information provided in the table, the head coach for Rio Ave in the 2004-05 Primeira Liga was Carlos Brito, but Sporting CP had José Peseiro as their head coach during this time period. Therefore, the statement "Rio Ave's head coach was Carlos Brito and club Sporting CP has Carlos Brito as well" is refuted by the data presented in the table.
986	The statement is actually not supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Belenenses, which finished 15th in the liga of the 2003 - 2004 season, held their matches at Estádio do Restelo, while Benfica, which finished 2nd in the liga of the 2003 - 2004 season, held their matches at Estádio da Luz. These two teams' stadiums do not match the locations provided in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
987	The statement appears to be supported by the table. According to the table, José Couceiro was the head coach of Vitória de Setúbal, which is a city in Portugal. Meanwhile, Manuel Machado was the head coach of Vitória de Guimarães, which is also a city in Portugal. Therefore, it can be concluded that the statement is true, and the information presented in the table supports it.
988	The statement is not entirely accurate based on the information presented in the table. According to the table, Porto was indeed the first-placed team in the 2003-2004 season, but Benfica was not from the city of Porto, they were from Lisbon. Therefore, the statement is partially true (Porto being the first-placed team), but false on the part about Benfica being from the same city as Porto.
989	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP are all football clubs from Lisbon. The fourth club from Lisbon is Estoril-Praia, which is also included in the table. Therefore, the statement that "clubs Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP are three of four places with Lisbon as the city" is supported by the information presented in the table.
990	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. Both female characters, Joan Leaven and Dr. Helen Holloway, have a status of "dead" in the table.
991	The statement "the only person to have a status of alive after exiting the cube is male" is supported by the information presented in the table. Out of the six characters listed in the table, only one character, Kazan, has the status of being alive after exiting the cube, and he is male.
992	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Only one female character in the cube film series, Joan Leaven, had a prison connection in the USA (Leavenworth prison). The other characters listed in the table had prison connections in Russia, France, and the UK, but not the USA. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information in the table.
993	The statement "Quentin is the only person to be a police officer in the cube" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, Quentin is the only character who is a police officer, and none of the other characters have that occupation.
994	The statement is supported by the information in the given table. The only character listed in the table as a "prison escapist" is Rennes, who is played by Wayne Robson and is shown as dead in the table's final column for status. Therefore, the statement "the only person listed as a prison escapist has a status of dead" is true based on the given table.
995	The statement "both females left the cube alive" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, there are two female characters in the Cube (film series), Joan Leaven and Dr. Helen Holloway. However, both of them are marked as "dead" in the last column of the table, which indicates that they did not leave the cube alive. Therefore, the statement "both females left the cube alive" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
996	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table provided, only one character, Kazan, a male with an autistic savant occupation, left the cube series alive. All the other characters listed in the table, regardless of their gender or occupation, have either died or their status is unknown. Therefore, the statement "both a male and female left the cube alive" is not supported by the information in the table.
997	The statement "both females had a prison connection in the UK" is supported by the table. Joan Leaven, who was a mathematics student, had a prison connection in Leavenworth prison in the USA (row 5 of the table). However, Dr. Helen Holloway, a free clinic doctor, had a prison connection in Holloway Women's prison in the UK (row 6 of the table), supporting the statement that there was at least one female character with a prison connection in the UK.
998	The statement is supported by the information given in the table. The table shows that Quentin was a male police officer with a prison connection to San Quentin State Prison in the United States. Therefore, it can be inferred that Quentin was one of the police officers who were in the cube.
999	The statement "multiple people were prison escapists and each left the cube alive" is refuted by the information presented in the table. While there are characters in the table who are identified as having a prison connection, only one of them - Rennes - is referred to as a "prison escapist." Further, Rennes is listed as being dead, not alive after leaving the cube. Therefore, the information presented in the table does not support the statement that multiple people were prison escapists and each left the cube alive.
1000	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The episode that originally aired on December 17, marked as "season 6, series 43" has the Nick production number 343.The episode that aired on December 7, marked as "season 4, series 41" has the Nick production number 341, which is lower than the episode that aired on December 17.The episode titled Ray J, marked as "season 14, series 51" has the Nick production number 351, which is higher than the episode that aired on December 17.
1001	The statement "three episodes have titles beginning with the letter t" is supported by the table. The three episodes that have titles beginning with the letter "T" are:1. Tia & Tamera Mowry / LL Cool J2. Tony! Toni! Tone!3. Sherman Hemsley / NasTherefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1002	The statement cannot be determined from the information presented in the table because there is no episode mentioned with a production number one higher than the Aaliyah episode. The highest production number mentioned in the table is 356 for the episode featuring MC Lyte. Therefore, it is unclear if the episode featuring Aaliyah was shown later than the episode with a production number one higher.
1003	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 11 and 15 have episode titles that consist entirely of numbers, "112" and "For Real" respectively.
1004	The statement is supported by the table. The episode with series 47 is "Chris Farley / Mint Condition", which had an original air date of January 11, 1997. The episode with season 2 is "Montell Jordan", which had an original air date of November 23, 1996. As we can see from the table, these two episodes were indeed aired in different months and years, with the episode featuring Chris Farley and Mint Condition being aired in January of 1997, while the episode featuring Montell Jordan was aired in November of 1996.
1005	The statement is not supported by the table. The production number for the episode that aired on December 17th is 343, which is lower than the production numbers for both the Ray J episode (351) and the episode titled "702" (345).
1006	That statement is supported by the information in the table. Only one episode title in the table starts with the letter "T", and that is "Tia & Tamera Mowry / LL Cool J", which aired on November 16, 1996, and is listed in row 2 of the table. Therefore, the statement that only one episode title started with the letter "T" is true based on the information provided in the table.
1007	The statement "the episode called Aaliyah was the first episode to air" is not supported by the information in the table. The table lists multiple episodes with different season numbers and original air dates, and the episode titled "Aaliyah" has a season number of 16 and an original air date of October 4, 1997. Therefore, it was not the first episode to air.
1008	The statement is supported by the table. Each episode title listed in the table contains letters somewhere within the title.
1009	The table provided does not support or refute the statement about seasons 2 and 10 of All That. The table only lists the episode titles, original air dates, and Nick prod numbers for various episodes across different seasons. It does not provide information about the timing of the seasons themselves.
1010	The statement is supported by the table. As per the provided table, the "mountains classification" was not awarded in Stage 1, and all other stages have a name listed as the winner of the mountains classification. Therefore, we can conclude that "stage 1 was the only stage where a mountains classification wasn't awarded".
1011	According to the provided table, Caisses d'Epargne had the team classification win in all stages except the first stage, therefore the statement that Caisse d'Epargne had the most team classification wins with eleven is supported by the table.
1012	The statement "Tyler Farrar was the winner of the stage three times" is supported by the table for the 2010 Vuelta a España. According to the table, Tyler Farrar was the winner of stage 5, stage 13, and stage 21 of the race.
1013	According to the table you provided, the statement "Mickael Delage is the only person to appear in the mountain classification just one time" is supported. In row 3 of the table, it shows that Mickael Delage appears only once in the mountains classification, whereas all other riders appear more than once. Therefore, the statement is true and supported by the data presented in the table.
1014	Refuted. The table includes several instances of different riders winning consecutive stages. For example, in row 13 and 14, Mark Cavendish won two consecutive stages, but he is not the only rider to have accomplished this feat. In rows 11 and 12, Igor Antón also won two consecutive stages. Therefore, the statement "mark cavendish is the only person to win two consecutive stages" is refuted by the table.
1015	The statement "stage 1 was the only stage where a team classification wasn't awarded" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, the team classification was not awarded for stage 1, whereas it was awarded for all the other stages.
1016	I apologize for the delay. After analyzing the provided table, I found that the statement "Caisse d'Epargne had the least team classifications with 3" is not supported by the information presented. In fact, Caisse d'Epargne won the team classification category 7 times during the 2010 Vuelta a España, which is the most among all teams. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1017	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Tyler Farrar won two stages of 2010 Vuelta a España (stage 5 and stage 21). Therefore, the statement that Tyler Farrar did not win any stages is not supported by the information in the table.
1018	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, the Mountains classification was won by three different riders: Serafín Martínez, Vincenzo Nibali, and Igor Antón. While Mickaël Delage did win a stage, he did not win the Mountains classification, and hence the statement "besides Mickaël Delage, there were only one other winner in the mountain classification" is false.
1019	The statement "Mark Cavendish consecutively won 5 stages" is *not* supported by the table. While Mark Cavendish did win multiple stages during the 2010 Vuelta a España, the table shows that he did not win five consecutive stages. Specifically, Cavendish won the first stage of the race, then won again on stage 2, before going several stages without a victory. He then won two more stages later in the race. So, while Cavendish won a total of 3 stages during the race, the wins were not consecutive.
1020	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the information presented in the table, in 1986, the value for "us dance" was 6 and the value for "us r&b" was 9, so the statement is true.
1021	The statement "Under the Influence charted at 56 in the US in 1985 and 1986" is not accurate based on the information provided in the table. According to the table, "Under the Influence" was released in 1986, not 1985, and it charted at number 56 in the US. There is no mention of "Under the Influence" charting in the US in 1985. Therefore, the statement is partially supported because "Under the Influence" did chart at number 56 in the US, but it only did so in 1986, not 1985.
1022	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Casey Martin had zero earnings in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Therefore, the statement that his lowest yearly earnings were zero is supported for those years but refuted for the other years where he earned money.
1023	The statement "Casey Martin never won a tournament" is supported by the table. As we can see in the "Wins" column, the entries for all the years mention "0," which means Casey Martin did not win a tournament in any of the years listed.
1024	The statement "the number of tournaments played in 2000 was 2" is not supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Casey Martin played 29 tournaments in the year 2000, as shown in row 2 of the table. The number of tournaments played in 2000 is clearly stated in the table, and it is not 2. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1025	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 19 states that Tatyana Lebedeva of Russia set the record for the triple jump event with a distance of 15.14 meters, with a wind assistance of +0.3 m/s, on September 5, 2003. Therefore, it can be confirmed that Tatyana Lebedeva was indeed the athlete in the triple jump event.
1026	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that there were two athletes who set records in the Javelin Throw event at the Memorial Van Damme competition. Fatima Whitbread set the record of 72.18 m with the old design on 5 September 1986, while Trine Hattestad set the record of 67.76 m with the current design on 25 August 2000. Therefore, while Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad were both athletes who set records in the Javelin Throw event, it is not accurate to say that Fatima Whitbread Trine Hattestad was the athlete in the Javelin Throw event, as they set records in different years and with different equipment.
1027	The statement that Milcah Chemos has a record of 9:15.06 in the 3000 m steeplechase event is supported by the information in the table. In row 15, the table shows that Milcah Chemos from Kenya achieved the record of 9:15.06 in the 3000 m steeplechase event on September 6, 2013, during the Memorial Van Damme competition. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1028	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the 400m record was set at 48.83s on September 4th, 2009 by Sanya Richards from the United States.
1029	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the pole vault record of 4.93 m was set on 26th August 2005 by Yelena Isinbayeva from Russia.
1030	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 21 of the table, the record for the discus throw was set on September 5th, 1986, and the athlete who achieved the record was Tsvetanka Christova from Bulgaria with a distance of 69.84 m.
1031	The statement "Tatyana Lebedeva was in the long jump event" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 19, Tatyana Lebedeva, who is from Russia, competed in the triple jump event, not in the long jump event.
1032	The statement you provided is not supported by the table. The table lists Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad as athletes from the United Kingdom and Norway, respectively, in the javelin throw event, not in the discus throw event. Therefore, the statement "Fatima Whitbread Trine Hattestad was in the discus throw event" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1033	I apologize, but there seems to be a mistake in the statement you have provided. The table shows that Milcah Chemos' record in the 3000m steeplechase at Memorial Van Damme is 9:15.06, not 19:15.06. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1034	Based on the information provided in the table, we see that the record for the 400 m event is 48.83 and it was achieved by Sanya Richards of the United States on September 4, 2009. Therefore, the statement "the record for the 400 m event before September 4, 2009 is over 48.83" is refuted by the table.
1035	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "pole vault was the event before August 26, 2005" is supported. The table lists the women's pole vault record set by Yelena Isinbayeva on August 26, 2005. All the events listed in the table took place before or on August 26, 2005, indicating that the pole vault event occurred before that date.
1036	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the date for the discus throw for Bulgaria was September 5, 1986, which is the exact date mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the date of the discus throw for Bulgaria was not after September 5, 1986, but rather on that exact date.
1037	The statement "game 4 was on April 25" is supported by the information in the table. In the table given, the game in row 4 is listed as "4| April 25| Dallas| L 90 - 99 (OT)| Tony Parker (43)| Tim Duncan (10)| Tim Duncan (7)| American Airlines Center 20829| 1 - 3;" which shows that game 4 was played on April 25, and the San Antonio Spurs lost that game to the Dallas Mavericks with a score of 90-99 in overtime.
1038	The statement "game 4.0, series 1-4 was on April 25th" is supported by the information in the table. We can see in row 4 that the game took place on April 25th against Dallas, the score was 90-99 in favor of Dallas in overtime, and the series score was 1-3 in favor of Dallas. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
1039	I apologize for the confusion in my initial response; The statement you provided is incorrect as it refers to game 2 instead of game 4 based on the table you provided.The correct statement that can be supported or refuted by the table is: "Game 3 had a location attendance of American Airlines Center 20491 and the series was 1-2." This statement is supported by the table as we can see in the third row of the table, where the game number is 3, the location attendance is American Airlines Center 20491, and the series was indeed 1-2.
1040	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Thomas Bjørn finished with a score of 68 + 71 + 76 = 215, which is tied for 6th place overall.
1041	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts from the United States finished the 1998 open championship with a total score of "68 + 69 + 73 = 210" strokes to par, which was enough to secure the first place, indicated in row 1.
1042	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Justin Rose finished in 5th place with a score of 72 + 66 + 75 = 213.
1043	The statement is supported by the information in the table as the row 7 shows that Thomas Bjørn from Denmark has a score of 68 + 71 + 76 = 215, which puts him tied at 6th place. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1044	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Brian Watts finished in 1st place with a score of 68 + 69 + 73 = 210, which is exactly what the statement says. Therefore, we can say that the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1045	The statement is not accurate. Brian Watts is not from Sweden; he is from the United States. Additionally, he finished with a score of even par (E), not +2 as stated in the statement. However, the statement is correct in stating that he finished at the tied 2nd place with a total score of 210, which is (68+69+73).
1046	The statement is not supported by the table. The player on the first place is Brian Watts from the United States, and he has a score of 68 + 69 + 73 = 210, which is a score of E (even par). Justin Rose, on the other hand, has a score of 72 + 66 + 75 = 213, and he finished in 5th place. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1047	The statement "the player from the United States has a score of 68 + 71 + 76 = 215" is supported by the table. Thomas Bjorn, Brad Faxon, John Huston, and Tiger Woods, all players from the United States, have a score of 215. So, the statement is true.
1048	The statement is actually partially incorrect. The correct statement is "Brian Watts has a score of 68 + 69 + 73 = 210, representing the United States" as indicated in row 2 of the table. So, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1049	The statement "Justin Rose is from the United States" is refuted by the information in the table for the 1998 Open Championship. According to the table, Justin Rose is listed under "England" as his country of origin. Therefore, the statement is false.
1050	The statement is refuted by the table as Thomas Bjorn (Denmark) and Tiger Woods (United States) both achieved a score of 215, which puts them at a tied 6th place in the tournament. Therefore, they both have the same ranking and Thomas Bjorn did not rank lower than Tiger Woods in the 1998 open championship.
1051	Based on the table provided, the statement "Neil LaBute was nominated for best play in 2009" is supported by the first row of the table which shows that he was nominated for a Tony Award in the Best Play category in 2009 for his work in "Reasons to be Pretty".
1052	The statement "Thomas Sadoski was nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play in 2009" is supported by the table. In row 3 of the table, it's listed that Sadoski was indeed nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play in 2009. So, based on the information provided in the table, it can be concluded that the statement is true.
1053	Yes, the table supports the statement that "reasons to be pretty was nominated for Best Play more than one time." The table shows that the play was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, both in 2009.
1054	Based on the information in the given table, the statement "before 2009 was the only year that reasons to be pretty had a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony" is not supported. In fact, in 2009, "Reasons to be Pretty" had three nominees at the Drama Desk Award ceremony - Outstanding Play, Outstanding Actor in a Play, and Outstanding Director of a Play. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1055	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 7 of the table, East Carolina Pirates played against Alabama Crimson Tide on October 17, 1992, at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama, and lost the game with a score of 22-23. Therefore, the statement "Alabama was the opponent when they played at Legion Field Birmingham, AL" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1056	The statement "on November 14th, Louisville played at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Greenville, NC" is supported by the information presented in row 11 of the table, where it shows that Louisville played at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC, and lost to East Carolina Pirates by a score of 45-63 on November 14th.
1057	The statement "there were 80079 people in attendance when Alabama was the opponent" is supported by the table. According to the table, the game against Alabama took place on October 17th, and there were indeed 80,079 people in attendance at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.
1058	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, on October 10th, when UAB was the opponent, the attendance was recorded as 31002 in Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC.
1059	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 3 in the table, the game was played on September 12th against Chattanooga, and the attendance was 34,028 at Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC. Therefore, the statement "on September 12 , the attendance was 34028 against the opponent Chattanooga" is confirmed by the information in the table.
1060	The statement is supported by the table. The attendance of 80,079 is recorded for the game against Alabama at Legion Field in Birmingham on October 17, 1992.
1061	The statement is incorrect as the opponent was UAB when the attendance was 31,002, not 33,002. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table provided.
1062	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is incorrect. There is no September 11 listed in the table. The attendance for September 12, the second game of the season, was 34,028, as listed in row 3 of the table.
1063	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, UAB was not the opponent when the East Carolina Pirates played at the Legion Field in Birmingham, AL. The opponent at that game was Alabama, and the Pirates lost by a score of 22-23. The game against UAB was played at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC, and the Pirates won that game by a score of 26-7.
1064	The statement "67 + 68 + 70 = 205 was Tiger Wood's score" is supported by the table. As per the table, Tiger Woods scored 67 in the first round, 68 in the second round, and 70 in the third round, resulting in a total score of 205.
1065	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Justin Leonard from the United States scored 73 + 71 + 68 = 212, which is listed under "t8" (tied for 8th place) in the table.
1066	The statement "player Nick Faldo is from England" is supported by the table. We can see in row 9 of the table that the player Nick Faldo scored 70 + 76 + 66 = 212, and his country of origin is listed as England.
1067	The statement is supported by the table. Row 6 shows that Robert Allenby placed T5 with a score of 74 + 70 + 67 = 211, which is consistent with the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1068	The statement, "Tiger Woods' score was 205" is supported by the table. In row 2 of the table, under the column "Score", it shows that Tiger Woods scored 67 + 68 + 70 = 205 at the 2002 U.S. Open (golf).
1069	The statement is supported by the table. We can see in row 10 that Justin Leonard's score for the tournament was 73 + 71 + 68 = 212, which ties him for 8th place with Nick Faldo.
1070	The statement "Nick Faldo was the only player from England" is supported by the information presented in the table for the 2002 U.S. Open (golf). As per the table, Nick Faldo is the only player from England with a score of 212 and is listed in the 9th row. None of the other players in the table are from England, which confirms that Nick Faldo was the only player from England in the tournament.
1071	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6, Robert Allenby from Australia scored a 74 + 70 + 67 = 211, which puts him tied for 5th place with Pádraig Harrington from Ireland and Billy Mayfair from the United States.
1072	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. Row 11 of the table shows that Tom Byrum's score was 72 + 72 + 70 = 214, which is not equal to 211. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1073	I'm sorry, but the statement "United States' Davis Love III scored 73 + 71 + 68 = 212" is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Davis Love III scored 71 + 71 + 72 = 214, and therefore the statement is refuted.
1074	The statement "Nick Faldo is a player from Ireland" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Nick Faldo is listed as a player from England.
1075	The statement "Tiger Woods' score was less than 205" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Tiger Woods' score at the 2002 U.S. Open golf tournament was 67 + 68 + 70 = 205, which means his score was exactly 205 and not less than 205.
1076	The statement is supported by the table. Justin Leonard's total score in the 2002 U.S. Open (Golf) was 212, which was exactly the score required to tie for the 8th place according to the table.
1077	That statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there is no player from Ireland who participated in the 2002 U.S. Open golf tournament.
1078	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is incorrect based on the information presented in the table. The table shows that Tiger Woods placed first in the 2002 U.S. Open with a score of 205, which is 6 strokes better than a score of 211. Therefore, the statement that Tiger Woods scored a 211 and placed 5th is refuted by the table.
1079	The statement is supported by the table. Row 12 shows that the players who tied for 9th place with a score of 290 were Pat Fitzsimons, Arnold Palmer, and Tom Watson. The scores listed for Tom Watson in row 12 are indeed 67 + 68 + 78 + 77 = 290, confirming that the statement is true.
1080	The statement "t7 is the place of peter oosterhuis, who won 7500" is supported by the table. Peter Oosterhuis from England is listed in row 9, column "place" with a tie for 7th place (t7) and he is listed in column "money" as winning $7,500, which matches the statement.
1081	The statement "Jack Nicklaus of the United States has a score of 72 + 70 + 75 + 72 = 289" is supported by the information presented in the table. As per the table, Jack Nicklaus is tied at the 7th position with Peter Oosterhuis with a score of +5, and his score is indeed 72 + 70 + 75 + 72 = 289.
1082	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not accurate based on the information provided in the table. According to the table, Peter Oosterhuis is listed as being in T7, which indicates that he is tied for 7th place with Jack Nicklaus. However, the value of "10875" is listed under the names of four players who finished T3. Therefore, the statement that "t7 is the place of player Peter Oosterhuis, who has 10875" is refuted by the table.
1083	The statement "United States has a 69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289 score" could refer to Peter Oosterhuis, who is from England in the table, rather than a player from the United States, which could be confusing. Apart from that, the closest to the statement in the table is in row 8, where Jack Nicklaus from the United States scored 72 + 70 + 75 + 72 = 289, which indicates that the statement is supported by the table.
1084	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 4 of the table shows that during the season 2007-08 (1/2), Dwight Howard had an average of 23.8 points per game, and an average of 15.0 rebounds per game. Therefore, the statement "there was 23.8 points per game during the season where there were 15.0 rebounds per game" is accurate based on the information presented in the table.
1085	The statement is supported by the table. As per the fifth row of the given table, the season of 2010-11 (1/2) where the field goal percentage was 594 (2nd), Dwight Howard had 2.4 blocks per game. Therefore, the statement is accurate and is supported by the given table.
1086	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The selection mentioned in the statement is row 6, which shows that there were indeed 2.4 blocks per game. Additionally, the table lists the field goal percentage as 594, which confirms the second part of the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data in the table.
1087	I apologize, but there is no selection in the table where rebounds per game were 17. The highest rebound average listed is 16.1 in the selection from December 2007. Additionally, no selection in the table had a points per game average of 24.8. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table.
1088	Based on the provided table, the statement "the screening that started March 29th, 2006, was completed May 3rd, 2006" is supported. Row 11 of the table shows that "screening started" on March 27th, 2006, and "screening completed" on May 5th, 2006, which includes the time period of March 29th, 2006, to May 3rd, 2006. Therefore, the statement is consistent with the dates given in the table.
1089	I'm sorry, but the table does not include any information about a screening that started on May 3rd, 2006, so I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1090	I'm sorry, but that statement doesn't seem to match the information provided in the table. The table lists the dates of various screenings for different chapters, but there isn't any information about a screening that was completed on 4 October 2006. Additionally, the table doesn't provide information on when the screening that was completed on 30 June 2006 was started relative to other screenings. Therefore, I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1091	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "climax straight - 4 has Lotus 16, Cooper T45, and Cooper T51 chassis" is supported. The table shows that the Lotus 16 and Cooper T45 both used a Climax straight-4 engine in 1959 and 1960, respectively. Additionally, the Yeoman Credit Racing Team used the Cooper T51 with a Climax straight-4 in 1960. Thus, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1092	The statement "climax straight - 4 has a Maserati 250f chassis" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, the Maserati 250f chassis is only associated with a Maserati Straight - 6 engine in both 1956 and 1957, and Bruce Halford is listed as the entrant for both years. Additionally, the table shows that the Climax Straight - 4 is associated with a Lotus 16 chassis in 1959, a Cooper T45 chassis for Fred Tuck Cars in 1960, and a Cooper T51 chassis for Yeoman Credit Racing Team in 1960. Therefore, there is no evidence in the table to support the statement in question.
1093	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the Toronto Maple Leafs is the only opponent with 63 points" is not supported. None of the opponents listed in the table have 63 points in the "points" column. The highest number of points held by an opponent is 60 points, which is shared by both the California Golden Seals and the Minnesota North Stars.
1094	The statement that "during March 13, the Toronto Maple Leafs were the opponent with 63 points" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table. The table provides data on the game schedule, scores, and records of a particular team, but it does not provide any information on the point standings of other teams during the same period. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny whether the Toronto Maple Leafs had 63 points during March 13, based on the given table alone.
1095	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. The opponent listed with 63, 66, and 69 points is indeed the Toronto Maple Leafs. In row 7, the opponent listed for 63 points is the Toronto Maple Leafs with a score of 3-2, in row 10, the opponent listed for 66 points is also the Toronto Maple Leafs with a score of 1-1, and in row 14, the opponent listed for 69 points is again the Toronto Maple Leafs with a score of 3-1. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1096	I apologize, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted based on the information given in the table. The table only shows the game number (row 1), date (row 2), opponent's name (row 3), score (row 4), record (row 5), and points (row 6) for a series of games. The table does not provide information about the point totals of the opponents of the team in question, so we can't determine if the Chicago Black Hawks were the only opponent with 63 points based on this table.
1097	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "for the 2018 season, the Air Force-Navy score is yet tbd" is supported. The scores for the game played on 6th October 2018 at Air Force, and the game that is scheduled to take place on 1st November 2018 at Army, are not listed in the table. The only information available for the 2018 season is that the Commander-in-Chief trophy game will be held on 8th December 2018, but the score is yet to be determined.
1098	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. In row 13, which represents the year 1983, the score for the air force versus Navy game is shown as 44-17, which is the same as the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1099	According to the table, there is a game scheduled between Army and Navy on December 10, 2016, at Baltimore, MD's M&T Bank Stadium. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1100	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the scores for air force - navy have all been decided up until 2018" is false. While there are scores listed for air force vs. navy games in the table, there are no scores listed for games after 2014. The table notes that the scores for the games in 2014, 2016, and 2018 are "tbd" or "to be determined." Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1101	The statement "for the 1983 season, the Air Force-Navy score is tbd" is refuted by the table. According to row 13 of the table, the Air Force beat Navy with a score of 44-17 in the 1983 Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. Therefore, the score is not "tbd" but is recorded as a win for the Air Force.
1102	Based on the table, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is true or false. The table provides information about the scores and winners of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy from 1972 to 2018. It does not contain information related to where the Army-Navy game was or will be played. Therefore, the table does not support or refute the statement.
1103	According to the table, the year when Lindaweni Fanetri won the girls' singles was in 2007. If we look at the same row in the table, we can see that the mixed doubles winners in 2007 were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto, which aligns with the statement. Therefore, based on the information in the table, the statement is supported.
1104	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is supported. In 2009, the girls doubles was played by Suci Rizki Andini Tiara Rosalia Nuraidah, while the boys doubles was played by Jones Ralfy Jansen Dandi Prabudita. However, in the same year, Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia won the girls doubles championship with a different partner.
1105	The statement is partially supported by the information in the table. According to row 6 of the table, in the year 2006, Nugroho Andi Saputro won the boys singles.However, the mixed doubles pair of Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debbie Susanto that year was not specifically listed as a winner in this table. It's possible that they won a different competition or were runners-up in the 2006 Indonesian National Badminton Championships. Therefore, the statement cannot be fully confirmed from the given table.
1106	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in 2007, Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati won the girls doubles, and Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto won the mixed doubles at the Indonesian National Badminton Championships.
1107	Based on the information in the table, we can see that Lindaweni Fanetri won the girls' singles championship in 2007. However, the table does not show that Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto won the mixed doubles championship in the same year. Therefore, the statement "when the girls singles is Lindaweni Fanetri, the mixed doubles is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto after the year 2007" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1108	The statement "in 2010, the girls doubles were Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia, and the boys doubles were Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita" is refuted by the table. According to the table, in 2010, the boys' singles winner was Shesar Hiren Rhustavito, the girls' singles winner was Ganis Nur Rahmadani, the boys' doubles winner was Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita, the girls' doubles winner was Aris Budiharti and Dian Fitriani, and the mixed doubles winner was Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico.
1109	The first part of the statement "in 2009, the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto and yayu rahayu" is supported by the table, as row 10 shows that Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu won in the mixed doubles category in 2009.However, the second part of the statement "and hermansyah is the boys singles" is not supported by the table, as row 9 shows that Hermansyah won in the boys singles category in 2008 and there is no entry for boys singles in 2009. Therefore, we cannot determine who won in the boys singles category in 2009 based on the given table.
1110	I apologize, but the statement "in 2010, when mixed doubles is Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto, the boys singles is Nugroho Andi Saputro" is not supported by the information provided in the table. According to the table, the winners in the 2010 Indonesian National Badminton Championships were Shesar Hiren Rhustavito in boys singles, Ganis Nur Rahmadani in girls singles, Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita in boys doubles, Aris Budiharti and Dian Fitriani in girls doubles, and Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico in mixed doubles. Nugroho Andi Saputro did not win a title in the 2010 championships according to the provided table.
1111	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the table. In 2009, the winners of the girls doubles category were Suci Rizki Andini and Tiara Rosalia Nuraidah, not Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati. Additionally, the winners of the mixed doubles category were Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayuk Basuki, not Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.
1112	The statement that "Christian de la Fuente's duration is 02x03 - 03x05" is supported by the table. According to row 14, Christian de la Fuente played the character of Sam Belmontes who was a trace technician, and his duration (first and final episode) was from 02x03 to 03x05, which matches the information in the statement.
1113	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 18, we see that Bob Keaton was a DEA agent, and his final appearances were in episodes 3x20 - 3x22, with the final episode he appeared in being titled "Vengeance". Therefore, the statement "the final episode for DEA agent was titled Vengeance" is supported by the information in the table.
1114	Refuted. The row that lists Max Martini is row 18, which states that his duration is from "02x08, 03x20 - 03x22." The duration of 02x03 - 03x05 is not listed for any character in this table.
1115	Refuted. According to the table, the first episode that Bob Keaton appeared in was "Big Brother" which was in season 2 episode 8. "Vengeance" was listed as an episode that he appeared in, but it was not his first episode.
1116	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, St Kilda was the home team, and they played against North Melbourne, who had a score of 12.11 (83).
1117	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Richmond played against Fitzroy at Punt Road Oval on July 13, 1946, with Richmond winning the game with a score of 14.14 (98) to Fitzroy's 10.12 (72).
1118	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Footscray scored 14.8 (92) when they visited Essendon on July 13, 1946, at the venue of Windy Hill.
1119	After analyzing the table, I can confirm that the statement is supported by the information in the table. The information in row 6 shows that St Kilda was the away team, and the home team scored 12.11 (83). Therefore, the statement is correct based on the data in the table.
1120	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that "Punt Road Oval" was the venue where Richmond played as the home team against Fitzroy, not as the away team.
1121	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 3 of the table, Essendon is listed as the home team, and Footscray is listed as the away team. The home team score is 16.24 (120) and the away team score is 14.8 (92). The venue is indicated as Windy Hill, and the crowd attendance is listed as 29,000. Thus, Essendon was the home team, and Footscray was the away team, contradicting the statement that Essendon was the away team which played against Footscray.
1122	The statement "on 13 July 1946, the home team scored 14.8 (92)" is refuted by the given table. None of the home teams scored "14.8 (92)", and the closest score is Essendon with a score of "16.24 (120)" at Windy Hill. Therefore, the statement does not match any of the scores in the given table.
1123	The table shows that the number of students enrolled at St. Andrews University is 600, which is consistent with the statement provided. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1124	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Presbyterian College is the college team whose nickname is Blue Hose, and they joined the conference in the year 1965.
1125	The statement is supported by the table. The college whose nickname is "Blue Hose" is Presbyterian College, and according to row 15 of the table, it joined in 1965 and left in 1972, and its current conference is Big South (NCAA Division I).
1126	Based on the table, the statement that "the conference for the college that left in 1974, and again in 1989, is the AAC (NAIA)" is refuted. According to the table, Lenoir-Rhyne University left and rejoined a conference twice: they joined the SAC in 1930 and left in 1985, then rejoined in 1989 and left again in 1974. However, the table indicates that their conference affiliation after leaving the SAC in 1985 was not the AAC (NAIA) but rather unspecified. Furthermore, when they rejoined the SAC in 1989, they remained in that conference until at least the time when the table was constructed. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1127	The statement is not accurate as per the given table for the chiefs - raiders rivalry.In 2012, the Oakland Raiders did win a game against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, but the score was 26-16, not 15-0. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1128	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 30 of the table, the "vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces" feature is available on AMT 3.0. Therefore, the statement "on amt 3.0 , the vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces feature is available" is true.
1129	The statement "when the computer has the feature of vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces it does not have amt 3.0" is refuted by the table. This is because the table shows that VLAN settings for Intel AMT network interfaces are supported in AMT 3.0 along with all subsequent versions of AMT. Therefore, the presence of the VLAN settings feature does not exclude the computer from having AMT 3.0.
1130	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "first elected" column in the table, we can see that all the incumbents were first elected before or in 1990, except for George Gekas from district Pennsylvania17, who was first elected in 1982, during the 1980s. Therefore, Pennsylvania17 is the only district with an incumbent who was first elected in the 1980s.
1131	The statement cannot be directly verified or refuted by the given table, as the table lists the incumbents' first elected years, but not their year of first election to the House of Representatives. However, we can make some inferences based on the information provided.The table shows the results of the 1994 elections for several House districts in Pennsylvania. It lists the incumbents' party affiliations, years of first election, and whether they were re-elected or not. Based on the table, we can see that there were three Republican incumbents (Clinger, Shuster, and Gekas) who were re-elected without facing any opposition in their respective districts, while one Republican incumbent (Santorum) retired to run for the US Senate, and his district was won by a Democrat (Doyle).There are also two Democratic incumbents (Klink and Murtha) who were re-elected with significant majorities, and another Democratic incumbent (Doyle in PA-18) who defeated a Republican opponent. The table does not provide information on how many Democratic incumbents were first elected in 1974.Thus, based on the information in the table, we cannot definitively say whether there were more Republican or Democratic incumbents who were first elected in 1974. Therefore, the statement is neither supported nor refuted by the given table.
1132	The statement "William F Goodling was one of six Republican incumbents to be re-elected" is supported by the table. In row 9, we see that William F Goodling, who is a Republican incumbent, was re-elected in the election. Additionally, rows 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 indicate that other Republican incumbents were re-elected, bringing the total to six Republican incumbents. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information presented in the table.
1133	The statement "bud shuster ran unopposed in the election" is supported by the table. In row 5 of the table, under the "opponent" column, there is no candidate listed, which indicates that Bud Shuster did not face any opponent in his campaign for re-election in the Pennsylvania 9th district during the United States House of Representatives elections in 1994.
1134	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows two incumbents, Bud Shuster and William F. Goodling, as Republicans who were first elected in 1974 and re-elected in the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections.
1135	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that the incumbent of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives elections in 1994 was John Murtha, a Democrat who had served in Congress since his first election in 1974, and who was re-elected in 1994 with 68.9% of the vote. Therefore, the statement that "district Pennsylvania12 has incumbent Ron Klink" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1136	I'm sorry, but I cannot support or refute the statement as the table you provided doesn't include bore specifications for each engine model. The table only contains information about the number of cylinders, bore (which is not specified for each model), capacity, power output, and weight. Therefore, I'm unable to determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1137	The statement "spy vs spy is in the arcade genre with amstrad cpc" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 13 of the table, "Spy vs Spy" is listed in the "arcade" genre, and it was released for the "c64" and "zx spectrum" platforms as well as the "amstrad cpc" platform in 1984, available on tape. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data presented in the table.
1138	The statement you provided is correct. However, the table you provided does not fully support or refute this statement. The table shows that "Kriegspiel" was released in 1983, but it does not provide information on how many other games in the genre of arcade were released in the same year. Without this additional information, it is impossible to determine whether there were any other arcade games released in 1983 alongside "Kriegspiel".
1139	The statement is refuted by the table. While "Spy vs Spy" is listed in the table under the arcade genre, it is not listed as being available for the Dragon 32 platform. Instead, it is listed as being available for the C64 and ZX Spectrum platforms as well as the Amstrad CPC. Therefore, the statement that "Spy vs Spy" is listed under the arcade genre with Dragon 32 is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1140	I found two instances where Jeff Gordon was a driver in the Pocono 400 race, according to the table provided - in 1996 and in 1997. However, neither of these races took place on June 16th. Therefore, the statement "on june 16th jeff gordon was on hendrick motorsports" is refuted by the table.
1141	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, on June 8th, 1997, Jeff Gordon drove for 200 laps in the Pocono 400 race.
1142	Supported. According to the table, in the Pocono 400 race held on June 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon participated as a driver for Hendrick Motorsports. Row 16 of the table confirms this, stating that Jeff Gordon was driving for Hendrick Motorsports in the 1996 race.
1143	The statement "In 1997, Jeff Gordon finished with a time of 3:34:33" is supported by the table. According to row 17 of the table, the Pocono 400 race held on June 8, 1997, was won by Jeff Gordon driving for Hendrick Motorsports with a race time of 3:34:33.
1144	The statement "on June 16th, Jeff Gordon was the driver in a Ford for Hendrick Motorsports" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Jeff Gordon won the Pocono 400 on June 8th, 1997 driving a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports.
1145	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in 1997 Jeff Gordon finished 200 laps at the Pocono 400 with an average speed of 139.828 mph.
1146	The statement "the team for Ricky Rudd is Joe Gibbs Racing" is incorrect. This statement cannot be supported by the information presented in the table. None of the rows in the table show Ricky Rudd as a driver, so there is no information about his team from this table.
1147	The statement "Jeremy Mayfield was the driver with 200 laps in 1997" is incorrect. While Jeremy Mayfield did win the Pocono 400 race in 1998, according to the table, he did not win the race in 1997. The table shows that Jeff Gordon won the race in 1997, completing all 200 laps.
1148	I'm sorry, but that statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table you provided. The table lists 21 episodes of Freddy's Nightmares, but there's no episode mentioned that belongs to a 13th season. In fact, there were only two seasons of Freddy's Nightmares, and they aired between 1988 and 1990. Therefore, it's impossible for season 13 to have been directed by William Malone.
1149	The statement is supported by the table. The table lists "Funhouse" as the title of the 17th episode of the first season of "Freddy's Nightmares", and lists Gilbert Adler as its director, along with A.L. Katz and Gilbert Adler as its writers. Therefore, we can conclude that Gilbert Adler did indeed direct the episode titled "Funhouse".
1150	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, row 15 shows that "Interior Loft" was directed by Ken Wiederhorn and originally aired on January 22, 1990. Therefore, the statement is accurate with regards to the information presented in the table.
1151	Based on the information provided in the table, this statement is refuted. "William Malone" directed two episodes after Season 6, which are "Easy Come, Easy Go" in Season 2 and "Prime Cut" in Season 3. Therefore, the statement that William Malone never directed after season 6 is not supported by the information in the table.
1152	The statement is partially correct. According to the table, the episode "Funhouse" was directed by Gilbert Adler rather than Al Katz. However, the episode was indeed written by Adler and A.L. Katz, so that part of the statement is correct. Therefore, the statement is partially supported by the table.
1153	Looking at the table, there are two rows associated with the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series:- The qualifying record for the Truck Series is held by Justin Lofton, with a time of 31.007 seconds, as shown in row 9.- The fastest race time for the Truck Series is held by Kyle Busch, with a time of 1 hour, 44 minutes, and 31 seconds, as shown in row 10.Therefore, the statement "the record and time are NASCAR Camping World Truck Series" is supported by the information in the table.
1154	The statement "the time for the record qualifying was 24.521" is supported by the information in the table. The time of 24.521 seconds is listed in row 12 of the table, under the "qualifying" column and the "izod indycar series" row for the Chicagoland Speedway. Therefore, the statement is true based on the table provided.
1155	The statement is supported by the table, as the table shows that Richie Hearn held the qualifying time of 24.521 for the Izod IndyCar Series race at Chicagoland Speedway on September 6, 2003.
1156	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, in the year 2007, the regional GVA (gross value added) was listed as 9432, and the industry was listed as 1565. Therefore, the statement is correct.
1157	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table. Since the table only includes data for individual years (1995, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2007), there is no way to calculate the total sum of agriculture for all five years listed without additional information. However, based on the data presented in the table, we can determine that the agriculture sector contributed 11 to the regional GVA (Gross Value Added) in each of the five years listed.
1158	Based on the given table, the statement is refuted. The conditions mentioned in the statement are: - When year is greater than 2003- When industry is less than 1465 - When regional gva is greater than 9432 When we look at the table, we can see that:- For the year 2005, the services value is 7502 which is greater than 7.- For the year 2007, the services value is 7856 which is greater than 7.- For the industry value less than 1465, we can see that the services value for the year 2005 (7502) is greater than 7.- For the regional gva value greater than 9432, we can see that the services value for the year 2005 (7502) and 2007 (7856) are both greater than 7.Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1159	I apologize, but this statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table. The statement provides a condition in which agriculture is equal to 54, but none of the rows in the table match all of the conditions specified in the statement. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the statement is true or false based on the given table alone.It's possible that there is additional information that could help to evaluate the statement, but using only the table provided, it's not possible to determine if the statement is supported or refuted.
1160	According to the table, the statement is supported by the information presented. In the 1987-88 season, Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points, which is listed in the table under the column "1987-88". Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1161	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is somewhat unclear, and it's not immediately clear to me what you are asking. If you can, please rephrase the statement or provide more context, so I can understand what you're trying to say. Alternatively, you can provide a different statement, and I'll be happy to check if it's supported or refuted by the table you provided.
1162	Based on the information in the provided table, the statement "at 20.45 the react was less than 164 in lane 6" cannot be confirmed or refuted. The table includes details about the athletes' lanes, names, nationalities, times, and reaction times. However, the statement refers specifically to the reaction time in lane 6 at the 20.45 mark. There is no information in the table that measures or indicates the reaction time at that specific point. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven or disproven by the given table data.
1163	The statement is refuted by the table. Wallace Spearmon's time was 20.39 seconds, while Rondell Sorillo's time was 20.63 seconds. Therefore, Rondell Sorillo's time was more than Wallace Spearmon's time.
1164	The statement that "athlete Visa Hongisto from Finland was in lane number 9" is incorrect. The table does not contain any information about an athlete with the name Visa Hongisto, and none of the runners are listed as being in lane number 9. The table shows that Thuso Mpuang from South Africa was in lane 2, Paul Hession from Ireland was in lane 8, and the other athletes were in lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1165	The statement is supported by the table. Row 3 of the table lists the game between the Indianapolis Colts and the New York Giants, played on September 10 at the Giants Stadium, with a final score of 26-21 in favor of the Indianapolis Colts.
1166	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, on December 10, the Dallas Cowboys played at Texas Stadium against the New Orleans Saints and lost with a final score of 42-17. Therefore, the statement that the Dallas Cowboys lost at Texas Stadium on December 10 to the New Orleans Saints is true based on the information in the table.
1167	The statement "On September 17, the final score at Texas Stadium was 10-27" is supported by the information in the table. Row 4 of the table shows that the Washington Redskins were the visiting team, and the Dallas Cowboys were the host team on September 17. The final score of the game was 10-27, with the Dallas Cowboys defeating the Washington Redskins at Texas Stadium.
1168	The statement is supported by the table with row 3 showing that on September 10th, 2006, the Indianapolis Colts visited Giants Stadium as the visiting team and won with a final score of 26 - 21 against the New York Giants.
1169	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table does not show any record of a game between the Denver Broncos and the Chicago Bears being played at the RCA Dome with a score of 23-8.
1170	I apologize, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the Dallas Cowboys played against the Seattle Seahawks at Qwest Field on January 6th, not December 31st. Additionally, the final score of the game was not 20-9 with the Cowboys leading, but rather 21-20 with the Seahawks coming out victorious. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1171	I'm sorry, but the statement is incorrect. The final score on September 17 was 7-17, not 10-27, as listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1172	The statement is refuted by the table. The final score for the game at Giants Stadium when the Chicago Bears were the visiting team was not 26-21. According to the table, the Chicago Bears played a game at Giants Stadium on November 12th, 2006, and the final score was 38-20, with the Chicago Bears winning against the New York Giants.
1173	The statement "Roger Dutton / Tony Wright received 3 points for 8th place" is supported by the information presented in the table. We can see in row 9 that they finished in 8th place and were awarded 3 points. Therefore, the statement is true.
1174	The statement "the 5th place BMW went at 82.32 mph" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Barry Dungworth and RW Turrington, riding a BMW, finished in 5th place with an average speed of 82.32 mph.
1175	This statement is supported by the information in the table. In the "points" column, the row corresponding to Roger Dutton and Tony Wright shows a value of "3," which is greater than "2." Therefore, "2 is the fewest points that Roger Dutton / Tony Wright received" is a correct statement based on the table.
1176	Based on the table provided, the statement "the BMW has less than 6 points with a speed of 82.32 mph" is supported. Looking at the table, we can see that the BMW ridden by Barry Dungworth and R.W. Turrington had a speed of 82.32 mph and was placed fifth with a score of 6 points, which is equal to or greater than 6 points. Therefore, the statement is refuted because the BMW didn't have less than 6 points with a speed of 82.32 mph.
1177	This statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that not every team had several wins. For example, in row 2, the BVM Minardi team did not win any races during the 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italy series. Similarly, in row 6, the BVM Minardi team did not win any races during the 2008 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 series. However, it is worth noting that some teams did have several wins. For example, in row 4, the BVM Minardi team won all four races during the 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italy Winter Series. In row 9, the BVM-Target Racing team won three races during the 2010 Italian Formula Three Championship.
1178	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the 8th-ranked player in the 2007 Fedex Cup playoffs was Charles Howell III, who is listed as being from the United States. Therefore, the statement "the United States is the home country of the 8th-ranked player" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1179	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 4 of the table, under the "country" column, it is stated that Phil Mickelson is from the United States. Therefore, the statement "the United States is the home country of Phil Mickelson" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1180	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Vijay Singh had 19,129 points after playing in 23 events. Since he was one of the top players in the FedEx Cup standings at the time, he had his points "reset" to 99,000, as indicated in the "reset points" column next to his name. Therefore, 99,000 is the number of reset points for 23 events for Vijay Singh.
1181	The statement is refuted by the table. Although the majority of the players listed in the table are from the United States, the player Vijay Singh, who is ranked second in the 2007 FedEx Cup playoffs, is from Fiji, not the United States.
1182	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table. The table only lists the top nine players and their points, events played, and reset points at the end of the 2007 FedEx Cup Playoffs. It does not contain any data related to the lowest reset points or events played.If you have any other statement or question related to the table, I'll be happy to check it for you.
1183	The statement "25.7 million international tourists visited Russia in 2012" is supported by the table. In row 9, it shows that Russia had 25.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012. Therefore, the statement is correct.
1184	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, in the UNWTO region of Asia, there were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012, which is actually slightly higher than the number of tourist arrivals in 2011 (57.6 million). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1185	The statement "from 830 BC, the state is Song" is supported by the information in the table. The table lists Song as a sovereign state with Duke Hui as its leader in row 17, and he was in power in 830 BC. Therefore, the statement is accurate according to the information presented in the table.
1186	Based on the table, the statement appears to be true. Rows 9 and 10 list the state as "jin" and the names of the sovereigns as "xi" and "xian" respectively, indicating that "xi" or "xian" is the name when the state is Jin.
1187	The statement is supported by the table. In row 2, the state is cai, and the name of its sovereign is yi. Additionally, the royal house of cai is listed as ji. Therefore, we can conclude that in cai, the name of the sovereign when the royal house is ji is yi.
1188	Based on the information in the table, the statement is supported. Row 9 and row 10 both list the state as Jin and the title as Marquis for Xi, while the state is Jin and title is Marquis for Xian in row 1 and 10. Therefore, it can be inferred that Xi and Xian are both titles associated with the state of Jin, with Xi being associated with the title of Duke, and Xian being associated with the title of Marquis.
1189	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, Yi was the name of the Marquis who ruled the state of Cai in 837 BC, not 826 BC. Additionally, the table does show that the ruling royal house of Cai during Yi's reign was Ji, which supports the first part of the statement. However, the statement did not specify the details of Yi's title, therefore it cannot be confirmed or refuted by the table.
1190	The statement appears to be supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the state of Wey had a sovereign named Li, who held the title of marquis and ruled from 855 BC. As per the table, there are no other states that had a sovereign ruling in the year 830 BC, so the state must refer to the Wey kingdom. Therefore, the statement "when the from is 830 bc, the state is Wey" is supported by the information provided in the table.
1191	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table's row 6, Detroit Pistons had a match against Charlotte on October 16th, and Greg Monroe had the high of 8 rebounds in that game. The table's row 6 also shows that Detroit Pistons lost that game with a score of 94-97 (ot), which means that their record after that match was 2-4. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1192	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, in the game against Atlanta on October 11 (row 4), Rodney Stuckey scored the highest number of points with 16, and Greg Monroe scored 7 rebounds, which is not the highest in that game. In fact, both teams had several players who scored more rebounds than Monroe in that game. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1193	The statement "player Austin Daye (16) scored the highest number of points in the game and the team was Dallas" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, the game with Dallas on October 13, 2010, was lost by Detroit Pistons by 101-96 in an overtime match, and Austin Daye scored 16 points, which was not the highest score in the game. The high points for Dallas are not mentioned in the table, so it cannot be said whether any Dallas player scored more points than Daye or not.
1194	The statement "player Will Bynum (5) scored the highest number of assists in the game, and the attendance was 11747 people at Carrier Dome" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, in the game against Minnesota on October 15th, Will Bynum recorded five assists, which was the highest number of assists in that game. Furthermore, the attendance for that game was 11,747 people at Carrier Dome.
1195	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. While Austin Daye did have a high score of 16 in the game against Dallas (row 4), the Pistons lost that game in overtime, making their record at that point of the season 2 - 2. It was not the game where Austin Daye did the high rebounds, as both Ben Wallace and Jason Maxiell had the high rebounding numbers in that game with 8 rebounds each. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1196	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Ben Gordon only had 5 rebounds in the first game against Miami, and Rodney Stuckey did score the highest points in that game with 17 points. Therefore, the statement that "Ben Gordon (17) did the high rebounds in the game in which Rodney Stuckey (16) did the high points" is not supported by the data in the table.
1197	The statement "Dallas was the opponent in the game in which Austin Daye (16) did the lowest points" is supported by the table. In row 4, it shows that the Detroit Pistons played against Dallas Mavericks on October 13, 2010, and lost the game 96-101 (OT). Also, in the same row, it shows that Austin Daye scored 16 points in that game, which is the lowest he scored in any of the games listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1198	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the game played at Carrier Dome with an attendance of 11,747 was on October 15th, and in that game, Will Bynum had 5 assists, but he was not the player with the highest assists. The player with the highest assists in that game was Rodney Stuckey with 5 assists. Therefore, the statement that "before October 15, Carrier Dome 11747 was the location attendance where Will Bynum (5) did the high assists played" is not supported by the table.
1199	This statement is refuted by the information in the table. While Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle, he was selected with the 83rd overall pick in the 3rd round, not the 19th pick. Therefore, the statement that "the only defensive tackle is Corey Peters, with a pick number of 19" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1200	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 5, we see that in the game against the New Jersey Nets on March 7, 1992, the Seattle Supersonics had a record of 34 - 27 and Nate McMillan had 7 high assists.
1201	The statement is supported by the table. The game on March 19th is listed in row 11, and the score is indeed given as "w 112 - 91", indicating that the Seattle Supersonics won with a score of 112 while Houston Rockets scored 91.
1202	The statement is false. According to the table, the location attendance of 16057 is associated with the game against the San Antonio Spurs at HemisFair Arena. The game was lost 101-96. Golden State Warriors do appear in the table, but with a different record and attendance number.
1203	The statement is supported by the table. If you look at row 7 of the table, it shows that the Seattle Supersonics played against the Detroit Pistons on March 10. The table also shows that Gary Payton had 8 assists in that game, which is the highest number of assists he had during the listed games. Therefore, the statement is true based on the data in the table.
1204	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the date for score of W 112 - 91 is after March 19" is supported. The score of W 112 - 91 is listed on row 11, which has the date of March 19. All the rows that come after row 11 have dates that are later than March 19, indicating that the score of W 112 - 91 was achieved on or before March 19. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1205	The statement "the song title for track 9 is just a little bit" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 9 shows that the track was recorded on July 22, 1973, and was featured on the album "Raised on Rock." The song title listed for track 9 in the table is "just a little bit," which confirms the statement.
1206	The statement is incorrect. Track 23 of the album "Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential '70s Masters" is "He'll Have to Go," not "Just a Little Bit." Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1207	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows Larry Mize and D. A. Weibring tied for 5th place with a score of 208 and a to par score of -5.
1208	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Fred Couples' score at the 1988 U.S. Open was 72 + 67 + 71 = 210, which is listed under his name in row 9. Therefore, the statement is true.
1209	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Mark O'Meara's score was 71 + 72 + 66, which equals 209, not 208 as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.
1210	The statement "Fred Couples had a score of 72 + 67 + 71 = 210" is supported by the table. In row 9, the table shows that Fred Couples had a score of 72 + 67 + 71 = 210 and finished in 8th place with a score of -3. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
1211	The statement is supported by the table. Larry Mize and D.A. Weibring are tied for 5th place with a score of 208, and they are followed by Mark O'Meara in 7th place with a score of 209. Scott Simpson is tied for 2nd place with Nick Faldo and Bob Gilder with a score of 207.
1212	The statement "Fred Couples has a score of 70 + 71 + 70 = 211" is supported by the table. In row 9 of the table, Fred Couples is listed as having a score of 72 + 67 + 71 = 210, which gives him a score of -3 (under par).
1213	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Mark O'Meara had a score of 71 + 72 + 66 = 209, which is listed in row 8. Therefore, the statement "Mark O'Meara is the second player with 71 + 72 + 66 = 209 as the score" is true based on the information provided in the table.
1214	The statement "Fred Couples had a score larger than 210" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Fred Couples had a score of 210, which means his score was not larger than 210. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1215	The statement is supported by the table. Row 12 in the table shows that on 15 / 04 / 07, Bradford played against Hull KR in the Super League XII and won with a score of 52-22, which matches the statement.
1216	The statement is supported by the information in the table, which shows that on 14/09/07, Hull FC beat Bradford Bulls 20-10, in a match played as part of the Super League XII. Therefore, the statement "the Super League XII score on 14/09/07 was 20-10" is supported by the information in the table.
1217	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the score on 15/04/07 was between Bradford and Hull KR, and the final score was 52-22 in favor of Bradford, but the attendance was listed as 10881, not 9000. So the statement is not completely accurate.
1218	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 25 shows that on 21/07/07, the score was 14-10, and the home team was Bradford.
1219	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table shows that on 7 May 1960, the home team North Melbourne played against the away team Richmond at Arden Street Oval. The table indicates that the game was attended by a crowd of 9000, which matches the statement. The table also shows that the away team Richmond scored 3.8 (26), which also matches the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1220	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 2 of the table, the away team is Richmond who scored 3.8 (26) and the home team is North Melbourne who scored 5.12 (42) on May 7, 1960.
1221	The statement in question is refuted by the information presented in the table. Looking at row 2 of the table, we can see that on May 7th, 1960, North Melbourne played against Richmond at Arden Street Oval in front of a crowd of 9,000 people, making it significantly smaller than the crowd size mentioned in the statement. Additionally, the away team (Richmond) scored 3.8 (26) while the home team (North Melbourne) scored 5.12 (42), which matches the scores mentioned in the statement. However, the statement claims that the crowd was larger than the stated figure, which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1222	The statement is supported by the table. We can see that Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser both had zero points (indicated by "0" in the "points" column) and grids larger than 4 (indicated by "9" and "16" in the "grid" column). Additionally, both drivers were on the American Spirit Team Johansson, as indicated in the "driver" and "team" columns. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1223	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Oriol Servià had a grid position of 4, he did not participate long enough in the race to earn any points. On the other hand, Ryan Hunter-Reay, who had a grid position of 9, finished the race in 13th place, earning 1 point. Therefore, only Oriol Servià fits the criteria stated in the statement, while Ryan Hunter-Reay does not.
1224	The statement "the total number of draws for bridgenorth was 0" is supported by the table. Looking at row 2, the number of draws for Bridgenorth is listed as 0, which confirms that there were no draws for Bridgenorth.
1225	Based on the table provided, the statement "bridgenorth has the highest number of wins in the ntfa div with 15 wins and only 3 losses" is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that Bridgenorth has recorded 15 wins and just 3 losses, which is higher than the other teams listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1226	The statement "George Town is the NTFA Div 1 team that has 8 wins and less than 2 draws" is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that George Town is in row 5 and has 9 wins and only 1 draw, which means they have less than 2 draws. Additionally, they are the only team in NTFA Div 1 to have exactly 8 wins, making the statement about their number of wins also true.
1227	Based on the information in the table, the statement "new jersey was the home team in the game on February 3" is supported. Row 2 of the table shows "February 3" in the "date" column, "NY Islanders" under the "visitor" column, "7-2" under the "score" column, and "New Jersey" under the "home" column. This indicates that the New Jersey team was indeed the home team for the game that took place on February 3.
1228	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 12 of the table, on February 27, New Jersey played against Buffalo and lost 2-6. Since "visitor" refers to the team that is playing away from home, New Jersey was the visiting team in this game.
1229	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. On row 2 of the table, the record was 11 - 32 - 11 and the score was 7 - 2 in favor of the New York Islanders. Therefore, we can conclude that the score was indeed 7 - 2 when the record was 11 - 32 - 11.
1230	The statement is supported by the information provided in the table. According to row 6 of the table, on February 12, the New Jersey Devils played as visitors against the St. Louis Blues and lost 1-5. At that time, the New Jersey's record was 11-35-12, which matches the record mentioned in the statement. Therefore, based on the provided table, we can conclude that the statement is true.
1231	I apologize, but I cannot verify this statement with the information provided in the table as there is only information about the scores, dates, visitors, home, and records of each game. There is no separate column in the table that specifies which team was home or visitor for each game, so I am unable to determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the information in the table.
1232	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 12 of the table, on February 27th, New Jersey was the visitor, and the score was 2 - 6 in favor of Buffalo. So the statement "when New Jersey was the visitor on February 27, the score was 2 - 6" is true based on the table.
1233	The statement "the score of the game with a 12 - 38 - 13 record is 2 - 6" is supported by the table. According to row 11, the game played on February 26th was between New Jersey and Pittsburgh, with the score being 4 - 5, and New Jersey's record following the game was 12 - 38 - 13. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1234	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, "February 12", the visiting team was "St Louis", and the home team was "New Jersey" when the record was "11 - 35 - 12".
1235	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not have any information about a game between Detroit and Chicago. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted with the information presented in the table.
1236	I apologize for the confusion in my previous message. Based on the table provided, the statement "on February 27 the score of the game with New Jersey as the home team was 2-6" is supported by the information in the table. This is because row 12 corresponds to February 27, and in this row, New Jersey is listed as the home team with a score of 2-6 against the visiting Buffalo team.
1237	There is no data related to February 4th in the table. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm or refute whether the game on February 4th had New Jersey as the home team based on the information presented in the table.
1238	The statement is supported by the given table. Looking at row 4, the visitor is Vancouver, while the home team is New Jersey. This means that New Jersey was the visiting team when they played against Vancouver as the home team.
1239	The statement is partially supported by the information provided in the table. According to the table, Susan Sarandon was the winner of the category "Favorite voice from an animated movie" in 2001 for her role in "Rugrats in Paris: The Movie." However, she was not a nominee in any other category in that year.
1240	That statement is supported by the table. According to row 5 of the table, "Rugrats Go Wild" was nominated for the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie in 2004, and Bruce Willis was the nominee for this award. Therefore, the statement "Bruce Willis was nominated for the film Rugrats Go Wild" is true based on the information provided in the table.
1241	I apologize, but the statement you provided is incorrect. The winner/nominee for the 2007 Favorite Movie Actor was Jack Black for his role in Nacho Libre, as indicated in Row 7 of the table. Rosie O'Donnell was nominated for the Favorite Movie Actress award in 1997 for her role in Harriet the Spy, as indicated on Row 2 of the table. Therefore, the statement "the winner / nominee (s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor was Rosie O'Donnell" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1242	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, "The Rugrats Movie" won the "Favorite Movie" category in 1999. Therefore, the statement "the result of the 1999 favorite movie was nominated" is not supported by the information provided in the table.
1243	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1, Trust Bank Building is listed in row 3 with 31 floors, and it held the title of tallest building from 1970 to 1973.
1244	The statement "there are no buildings with less than 196 feet" is refuted by the information in the table. The Mutual Heights Building in Cape Town, South Africa, listed in row 7 of the table, has a height of 298 feet, but there are no other buildings in the table with a height less than 196 feet.
1245	The statement "the carlton center, in Cape Town, has 50 floors" is not supported by the table. According to the table, the Carlton Centre is located in Johannesburg, not Cape Town, and it has been the tallest building in Africa since 1973, with a height of 223 meters (732 feet) and 50 floors.
1246	The given statement is incorrect, as per the table, the Schlesinger Building is not the fourth-largest building in Johannesburg. Instead, it is the fifth largest building in Johannesburg with a height of 361 feet. The fourth-largest building in Johannesburg is the Standard Bank Building, with a height of 455 feet.
1247	According to the table, the statement is supported. The home team on April 17 was the Chicago Black Hawks, and their record at that time was 2 - 3.
1248	The statement "on April 10 the Chicago Black Hawks vs Detroit Red Wings 's record was 1 - 1" is supported by the information in the table. In the second game on April 10, the Detroit Red Wings won 7-0 against the Chicago Black Hawks, which brought the record of the two teams to 1-1.
1249	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, on April 17, the Chicago Black Hawks were the visitor team and their record was 2-3 in that game. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1250	The statement is refuted by the table. The record for the game between Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks on April 14 was 2-2, not 5-3.
1251	The statement "On October 11th, the Black Knights lost to Duke" is supported by the table. The table shows that on row 6, the game was played on October 11th, and the opponent was Duke. The result of the game was a loss for the Army Cadets, with a final score of 21-10 in favor of Duke. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1252	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 3 of the table: "3| sept 27| villanova| loss| 0| 10| 2 - 1", the Black Knights lost to Villanova on September 27th, and their record dropped to 2 - 1 after this game. Therefore, the statement that "on September 27th, the Black Knights lost to Villanova dropping their record to 2 - 1" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1253	The statement "the black knights scored 54 points against Lehigh on September 20th raising their record to 2-0" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 3 shows that the Army Black Knights won the game against Lehigh with a score of 54 points to 32. Additionally, the "Record" column indicates that after two games, Army's record became 2-0, which confirms the statement.
1254	The statement "the black knights lost to Stanford, 67 - 14" is supported by the information in the table. In the fourth row of the table, it shows that the Army Cadets played against Stanford on October 4th and lost with a score of 14 to 67.
1255	I'm sorry, but the statement is refuted by the information in the table. The Black Knights did lose to Penn State on October 25th, but at that point, Penn State's record was 4-2. On September 27th, the Black Knights played against Villanova and suffered a loss with a score of 0-10. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table as it incorrectly states the date, opponent, and record of Penn State at the time of the game.
1256	The statement is refuted by the table. The Black Knights' record was 2-0 when they scored 54 points against Lehigh on September 20th, not 2-2.
1257	The statement is refuted by the information provided in the table. The black knights played against Stanford on October 4th, 1975, and they lost the game with a score of 67-14. The score mentioned in the statement (21-10) isn't reflected in the table, so the statement is incorrect.
1258	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 7, which includes the age group 15-17, the population for this age group is 10,357,874, which is the same value as stated in the statement.
1259	The statement appears to be supported by the information in row 7 of the table, which shows that the population of Brazil for ages 15-17 is 10,357,874. While the table does not explicitly mention the "unspecified" percentage of 0.0034%, it does show that the total population of Brazil is 190,755,799, and the sum of the population percentages for all the age groups adds up to approximately 100%. Therefore, it can be inferred that the unspecified 0.0034% is included in the total population figure. So, yes, the statement appears to be supported by the data in the table.
1260	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As per the information provided in the last row of the table, the Coquitlam Adanacs have earned a total of 1177 points over 45 seasons. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information in the table.
1261	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is refuted. The 1977 season had 24 games, 13 losses, and 22 points. While the number of losses and games matches the statement, the number of points is greater than 18 and less than 26.The 1978 season had 24 games, 13 losses, and 21 points. While the number of losses and games matches the statement, the number of points is less than 26.The 1989 season had 24 games, 13 losses, and 22 points. While the number of losses and games matches the statement, the number of points is less than 26.Therefore, none of these three seasons meet all three criteria stated in the statement, so the statement is refuted by the table data.
1262	The statement that "the team has been called the Coquitlam Adanacs throughout all 45 seasons since 1965" is supported by the table. The team name listed in all 47 rows of the table is "Coquitlam Adanacs", even in 1968 when they were referred to as the "Portland Adanacs" (which technically still included the name "Adanacs"). Therefore, it can be concluded that the team has been called the Coquitlam Adanacs throughout all 45 seasons since 1965.
1263	Based on the information in the table, the statement is refuted. None of the seasons listed in the table has more than 26 points, less than 18 games, and exactly 13 losses. The closest season with 13 losses is the 1978 season, but it has only 21 points and played 24 games, which does not meet the requirements of the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1264	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table shows that on April 29, 2012, Fabio Fognini played against Gilles Simon in the final of the BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy in Bucharest, Romania, and he was the runner-up in the match with a score of 4-6, 3-6.
1265	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6, Tommy Robredo was the opponent in the final on July 28, 2013, at the ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag, and Fabio Fognini lost the match 0-6, 3-6, finishing as the runner-up.
1266	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table shows that Fabio Fognini was the runner-up in the BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy tournament in Bucharest, Romania on April 29, 2012. The surface was clay, and Fognini played against Gilles Simon in the final. The score in the final was 4-6, 3-6, which is exactly what the statement says. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1267	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, on 29 April 2012, Fabio Fognini was a runner-up in the BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy tournament in Bucharest, Romania. His opponent in the final was Gilles Simon, and he lost the match 4-6, 3-6. Tommy Robredo is not mentioned anywhere in the table. Therefore, the statement that "29 April 2012 had an outcome of winner, where Tommy Robredo was the opponent in the final" is not supported by the information provided in the table about Fabio Fognini.
1268	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Fabio Fognini did compete in a final on 28 July 2013, but the tournament was the ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag, which did have a clay surface. Additionally, Federico Delbonis was indeed his opponent in a different final, but it was on 21 July 2013 at the International German Open in Hamburg, which also had a clay surface.
1269	No, the statement "the score in the final of 4 - 6, 3 - 6 was during the Stuttgart Open, Stuttgart, Germany, on clay surface" is not supported by the table. The score in the final of 4 - 6, 3 - 6 is actually from the Brd Năstase Țiriac Trophy in Bucharest, Romania, on clay surface, where Fabio Fognini finished as the runner-up. The Stuttgart Open final was won by Fabio Fognini as per the table.
1270	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Jean-Michel Ménard's team had Martin Crête as the third / vice skip and Éric Sylvain as the second. Row 10 shows Jean-Michel Ménard as skip, Martin Crête as third / vice skip, Éric Sylvain as second, and Jean Gagnon as lead from Lévis.
1271	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 7 of the table, we can see that the skip was Mike McEwen, and the lead was Denni Neufeld.
1272	According to the table, Steve Gould is the second (not the lead) in the Jeff Stoughton team, and the city of Winnipeg is listed as their hometown. Therefore, the statement that "Steve Gould is the lead in the city of Winnipeg" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1273	I apologize for my mistake earlier. After reviewing the table, I have to correct my previous response. The statement "Steve Gould is the lead in the city of Winnipeg and the third / vice-skip is Kevin Park" is refuted by the table. The table shows that Jeff Stoughton was the skip for the Winnipeg team, and Steve Gould was the second while Kevin Park was the third/vice-skip. The lead for the Winnipeg team was Garth Smith. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1274	The statement is supported by the table. In row 13 of the table, Tyler Forrest is listed as the lead for the team skipped by Jason Gunnlaugson from Beausejour.
1275	According to the table, the row with Ted Appelman does not mention a player named Brendan Melnyk. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the provided table.
1276	I apologize for any confusion, but the statement "Martin Crête is listed as a skip for Winnipeg" is not accurate based on the information provided in the table. Martin Crête is actually listed as the third/vice skip for the team from Lévis. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1277	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 7, "denni neufeld" is listed as a "second" and "winnipeg" is listed as the city, confirming that Denni Neufeld is indeed listed as a second for Winnipeg in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials.
1278	The statement "Steve Gould is lead in Richmond" is refuted by the information presented in the table for the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. According to the table, Steve Gould was the second for the Jeff Stoughton team from Winnipeg. There is no reference to a lead player named Steve Gould in the table, and there is no mention of Richmond as a city associated with any of the teams. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
1279	Based on the information in the table, the statement "Beausejour has a lead of Aaron Watson" is supported. The last row of the table (row 13) shows that Jason Gunnlaugson is the skip for the Beausejour team, with Justin Richter as third/vice skip, Braden Zawada as second, and Tyler Forrest as lead. Additionally, the table shows that Aaron Watson is listed as the lead for the Greg McAulay team from Richmond (row 12), not for the Beausejour team.
1280	Based on the table provided, the statement that "Brendan Melnyk is lead and Ted Appelman is third/vice skip" cannot be supported or refuted. The table only lists the names of the skippers, third/vices, seconds, leads, and cities they represent for the 2009 Canadian Olympic curling trials, but it does not provide any additional information about their roles in each team.
1281	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Pascal Fabre started in grid 26 and completed 71 laps in the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix, before retiring due to an unknown issue that caused him to finish in 14th place.
1282	The statement is partially supported by the table. According to the table, Michele Alboreto started the race in 5th position (grid 5), but he did not complete the race, as his engine failed after completing only 43 laps. Therefore, the least amount of laps completed by a driver starting from the 5th position on the grid was indeed 43, which supports the first part of the statement. However, the second part of the statement "the least amount of laps is 43.0" is inaccurate as there were other drivers who failed to complete the race and completed fewer laps than Alboreto, such as Danner, Nakajima, and Campos.
1283	Unfortunately, I cannot support or refute this statement based on the information provided in the table. The table shows information about the drivers, constructors, number of laps completed, time or reason for retirement and their respective grid positions for the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix. It does not provide any information about the relationship between the grid position and the number of laps completed. Without additional information, it's impossible to determine whether the statement is true or not.
1284	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the information in the table, as the grid position for Christian Danner is not listed as 5. In addition, there is no information in the table about any specific race where Christian Danner's performance might be referenced. Therefore, I cannot confirm or refute the statement based on the provided table alone.
1285	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, episode 149 "Fast Friends" was directed by John Tracy and written by Bob Sand.
1286	The statement "Tough Love was the title of episode 148" is supported by the table. In row 5 of the table, the episode with number 148 is indeed titled "Tough Love."
1287	The statement "Fast Friends originally aired on October 12, 1993" is supported by the table. According to the table, "Fast Friends" is the fifth episode of Full House season 7, and it aired on October 12, 1993.
1288	The statement "Fast Friends originally aired on October 11, 1992" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Fast Friends aired on October 12, 1993, which is a year later than the date mentioned in the statement.
1289	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, the episode "The Test" is listed in row 16 and has the episode number in the series as 159, which is greater than the episode number of 148. Therefore, the statement that "the episode number in the series The Test is before 148.0" is true based on the information provided in the table.
1290	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Daniel Uberti was appointed as the new manager of Nejapa on September 5th, 2008, and he was not sacked by the team during the season. In fact, he was replaced by Nelson Ancheta on December 29th, 2008, after the end of the regular season, with Nejapa finishing in 10th position in the table.
1291	The statement "Gerardo Reinoso was sacked by Firpo on August 25th, 2008" is supported by the information presented in the table. In row 3, under the "Manner of departure" column, it says "sacked" for Gerardo Reinoso. Under the "Date of vacancy" column, it shows that the date of the vacancy was August 25th, 2008. Furthermore, under the "Replaced by" column, it shows that Oscar Benitez replaced Gerardo Reinoso on September 2nd, 2008. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1292	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9 of the table, Daniel Uberti was sacked on December 29th, 2008, and Nelson Ancheta was appointed as the new manager of Nejapa on the same day.
1293	The statement "Roberto Gamarra is the outgoing manager of Nejapa" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the second row of the table, Mauricio Cienfuegos was the outgoing manager of Nejapa, who left by mutual consent on 14 August 2008. Later, on 5 September 2008, Gamarra replaced the outgoing manager after the board terminated his employment. Gamarra then left the team in mutual consent on 1 January 2009, as seen in the final row. Therefore, the statement is true, as Roberto Gamarra was a manager of the team during primera división de fútbol profesional apertura 2008.
1294	The statement "Daniel Uberti left FAS on 29 December 2008" is not supported by the table. According to the table, Daniel Uberti was actually sacked as Nejapa's outgoing manager on 29 December 2008 and was replaced by Nelson Ancheta on the same day. Later on, Nejapa appointed Carlos de Toro as the new manager after mutual consent with Roberto Gamarra on 16 January 2009. However, there is no mention of Daniel Uberti leaving FAS in the table.
1295	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Mauricio Cienfuegos left the team Nejapa by mutual consent on 14 August 2008. There is no information in the table indicating that Cienfuegos was sacked on 25 August 2008 or at any other point in time.
1296	Sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Daniel Uberti was not sacked on 29 December 2008, but rather he was the outgoing manager of Nejapa who left the team by mutual consent on 14 August 2008. He was later appointed as the replacement for the sacked Oscar Benitez at the same team on 5 September 2008. Additionally, there is no information in the table about Carlos de Toro replacing Daniel Uberti. On 29 December 2008, Nelson Ancheta was appointed as the replacement for Uberti as the manager of Nejapa.
1297	The statement "the home team scored 17.5 (107) on Sunday, January 30th" is supported by the information in the table. In row 2, the home team is Adelaide, and they scored 17.5 (107) against the away team Melbourne on Sunday, January 30th at Football Park.
1298	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. In Row 4, we see that St Kilda played at their home ground, Waverley Park, and Melbourne was the away team, and the scoreline was 13.14 (92) – 9.12 (66) in Melbourne's favor.
1299	The statement is supported by the table as Row 6 shows that St Kilda was the away team playing against Adelaide on Sunday, 13 February.
1300	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. None of the rows indicate that the away team scored 17.5 before a crowd of 12239 on Sunday, 30 January. The only row mentioning an away team scoring is row 2, which shows that Melbourne scored 19.11 (125) against Adelaide at Football Park on Sunday, 30 January, in front of a crowd of 12,239. However, the statement mentions an away team scoring 17.5, which is not supported by the data in the table.
1301	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Adelaide and Melbourne played each other at Football Park in Adelaide on Sunday, 30 January, and Adelaide was the home team while Melbourne was the away team, as indicated in row 2 of the table.
1302	The statement is supported by the table. In row 7 of the table, St Kilda is listed as the away team while Melbourne is the home team. The game was played on Monday, 14 February, as indicated by the date column. Therefore, the statement "St Kilda was the away team on Monday, 14 February" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1303	Refuted. According to the table, the opponent that the Blue Jays faced when their record was 4 - 5 was not the Yankees, but rather the Royals. The Blue Jays played the Yankees on April 12th, as shown in row 10, but at that point, their record was 4 - 4, not 4 - 5.
1304	Yes, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, on April 11, the Blue Jays had a record of 4-4, and they played against the Yankees that day.  The Blue Jays won that game with a score of 11-6, which brought their record to 4-5. So, the statement "when the record was 4-5, the opponent was Yankees on April 11" is supported by the data in the table.
1305	The statement "there are no defensive end picks and an overall smaller than 2" is supported by the table. The table shows that the Jacksonville Jaguars made their first pick in the 1996 NFL Draft in the 1st round with the 2nd overall pick. Their pick was Kevin Hardy, a linebacker from Illinois. There were no defensive end picks made in the draft by the Jaguars. Additionally, there were no picks made with an overall smaller than 2, as the Jaguars' first pick was the 2nd overall pick in the draft.
1306	The statement "the series number of the fallen star is 20" is supported by the table. According to the table, "The Fallen Star" is the title of the 20th episode in the series, as listed in row 21. Therefore, the statement is true.
1307	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "series number 8 had a production code of 208" is supported, as episode 8 (Rocket's Descent) of series 2 has a production code of 208. However, it's worth noting that the table doesn't contain information about series number 8, as it only goes up to episode 25 of series 2.
1308	The statement "episode 28 is titled the suspension" is supported by the table. In row 3 of the table, the episode number is 28, and the episode title is "the suspension." Therefore, the information in the table confirms that episode 28 is indeed titled "the suspension."
1309	The statement "episode 40 , series 14 is titled new order" is supported by the table. In the table, the information in row 15 shows that episode 40 corresponds to series 14 and is titled "New Order".
1310	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "episode 31 was originally aired on 19 April 2008" is supported. The table shows that episode 31 (titled "The Homecoming") was aired on April 19, 2008.
1311	The statement "one episode is titled the expulsion" is refuted by the table provided. As per the table, none of the episodes in the series is titled "the expulsion."
1312	Based on the table provided, the statement "the title of the episode with series number 14 is new rules" is supported. The table shows that the episode with series number 14 is titled "New Order", not "New Rules". However, the 16th episode of the series, with series number 16, is titled "New Rules".
1313	The statement is supported by the table. Episode 7 titled "Doubts Within" has an original air date of 26 April 2008. Therefore, the original air date of episode 7 is NOT 19 April 2008, but rather it is 26 April 2008.
1314	The statement "208.0 is the production code of the episode with series 9" is not supported by the table. According to the table, the episode with the production code 208 is titled "Rocket's Descent" and belongs to series 1, not series 9.
1315	I'm sorry, but the table about Orlando Pizzolato does not provide the necessary information to support or refute this statement. The table only lists Orlando Pizzolato's performance in various competitions between 1984 and 1988, but it does not include a comprehensive list of all competitions that took place in New York City during that time. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this table whether the New York City Marathon in 1985 was the latest year a competition was held in New York City.
1316	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Orlando Pizzolato won the 1988 Venice Marathon held in Venice, Italy with a time of 2:15:24.
1317	I'm sorry but the statement you provided is inaccurate. According to the table, Orlando Pizzolato participated in the New York City Marathon in 1984 and 1985, but not in 1986. In addition, there is no "notes" column in the table. Therefore, the statement you provided is not supported or refuted by the table.
1318	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Orlando Pizzolato participated in the 1984 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, where he finished in 16th position with a time of 2:15:20. The table also shows that Orlando Pizzolato won the 1988 Venice Marathon in Venice, Italy, with a time of 2:15:24. However, there is no mention of an Olympic Games being held in Venice, Italy in 1984 or any other year. Therefore, the statement that the Olympic Games were held in Venice, Italy in 1984 and had notes of 2:10:57 is refuted by the table.
1319	The statement that "there are currently 12 t-260 EU aircraft in service" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to row 12 of the table, the Uruguayan Air Force has 12 Aermacchi SF260s, which is the T-260 EU version specified in the statement.
1320	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "there are 3 c - 95 aircraft of Brazilian origin currently in service" is incorrect. The table indicates that there is only one Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante, which is a transport/utility aircraft, currently in service with the Uruguayan Air Force. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1321	I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any information related to the "t - 260 eu" aircraft in the table you provided, nor related to any 12 aircraft of any type. Therefore, I can neither support nor refute the statement with the information in the table. Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need further assistance.
1322	Refuted. The table shows that there are 3 Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante Brazilian aircraft currently in service, but there is no mention of "C-95" aircraft in the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1323	The statement "with 2 in service by the US, the Beechcraft represents the B58 model aircraft" is not accurate. While it is true that the Uruguayan Air Force has two aircraft in service that were manufactured by Beechcraft (specifically, the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, which is a transport/utility aircraft), these are not B58 models. B58 is the model code for the Beechcraft Baron, which is a different aircraft altogether. According to the table, the Uruguayan Air Force has two Beechcraft B58 Barons in service, but these are listed as being used for trainer/liaison purposes (not transport/utility), and not as being manufactured by the US (they are manufactured in the United States, but not specifically by the US government).
1324	The statement is refuted by the table. The table does not show any information about the B-58 aircraft model or a version of it being originated in the United States. The table does show information about Bell UH-1 Iroquois aircraft, which are listed separately from the B-58 aircraft model. The table shows that there are 13 Bell UH-1 Iroquois aircraft in service, not 2. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
1325	I believe there is an error in the statement you provided. The Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia is not from Switzerland, but from Brazil. Additionally, the table shows that the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia is a transport type aircraft, which supports the idea that it is a transport/utility aircraft. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1326	Looking at the table, we can see that Brazil is listed as the origin of three aircraft types: Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, and Embraer Tucano T-27 trainer. The Embraer EMB 110 and EMB 120 are listed as transport / utility aircraft, but there is no Brazilian aircraft listed as an attack type in the table. Therefore, based on the information in the table, the statement "Brazil has transport / utility and attack type aircrafts" is refuted.
1327	I'm sorry, but the information in the table does not support the statement that "there are 12 t - 260 eu aircraft currently in service that originated from Switzerland." The table only mentions one Aermacchi SF260 trainer aircraft from Italy that's currently in service - there's no mention of any aircraft with the designation t-260 eu in the table. Please check the accuracy of the statement or provide me with other information to verify.
1328	The statement "the aircraft Bell 212 Twin Huey was a trainer type" is not supported by the table. The table shows that the Bell 212 Twin Huey is classified as a transport/utility type aircraft, along with the Bell UH-1 Iroquois (UH-1H).
1329	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 3 of the table, the home team Carlton played the away team St. Kilda at Princes Park on 10 September 1927, with Carlton winning the game with a score of 15.16 (106) to St. Kilda's 7.9 (51).
1330	Based on the table provided, the statement that "Western Oval had Footscray as its home team" is supported. The table shows that Footscray played against Melbourne at Western Oval on September 10, 1927.
1331	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Carlton was the home team and played against St Kilda, who were the away team. Therefore, the information in the table contradicts the statement that Carlton was the away team when they played St Kilda in the 1927 VFL season.
1332	I am sorry to inform you that the given table does not provide any information that could either support or refute the statement that "Princes Park had Footscray as its home team." The table only presents match details such as the teams that played, the scores, venues, crowds, and dates. It does not provide any information about the home teams' actual official stadium. Thus, we cannot say with certainty whether or not Princes Park had Footscray as its home team based on the information given in the table.
1333	That statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Vodafone had 6,125 subscribers in 2005, and that was their lowest number of subscribers listed in the table.
1334	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, Glo Mobile had 9,000 subscribers in 2005 and increased to 11,000 subscribers in 2006, which is less than the maximum number mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement is true and is supported by the information presented in the table.
1335	The statement is supported by the table. Row 11 of the table states that "Mobilis" is a provider from Algeria and had 7,476 subscribers in 2006.
1336	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, "glo mobile" had 9,000 subscribers in 2005 and 11,000 subscribers in 2006, representing a growth rate of 22%. Therefore, the statement that "glo mobile of Nigeria has 11,000 subscribers in 2006" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1337	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 10, Vodafone had 8704 subscribers in Egypt in 2006.
1338	The statement is refuted by the table, as there is no mention of Vodafone having subscribers in Morocco in the table. The table only shows data for Airtel, Vodacom, MTN, Glo Mobile, Maroc, Djezzy, Mobinil, and Mobilis. Thus, we cannot make a conclusion regarding the number of subscribers Vodafone had in Morocco in 2005 based on the information provided in the table.
1339	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Glo Mobile is a mobile phone provider in Nigeria, not Morocco. Additionally, the table shows that Glo Mobile had 11,000 subscribers in 2006, but this figure is associated with Nigeria, not Morocco. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1340	I'm sorry, but that statement is not accurate. According to the table, the maximum number of 2006 subscribers is actually for Mobinil in Egypt, which is 9267. Mobilis is listed as having 7476 subscribers in 2006, but that is not the maximum number for that year or for any country. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information provided in the table.
1341	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Glo Mobile had 9,000 subscribers in 2005, and 11,000 subscribers in 2006. Therefore, it grew by 2,000 subscribers or 22.2%. This growth percentage is different from the 52% stated in the statement, but Glo Mobile did have a positive growth rate in 2006.
1342	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Vodafone had 6,125 subscribers in 2005 and 8,704 subscribers in 2006, which corresponds to a growth percentage of 42%. Thus, the statement that Vodafone had 8,704 subscribers in 2006 with 38% growth percentage is supported by the information presented in the table.
1343	The statement "Chris Young was the winning pitcher on June 25th" is supported by the table. In the table, in row 6, it is stated that the Texas Rangers won against Houston Astros with a score of 6-5, with Chris Young listed as the winning pitcher. Therefore, the table provides evidence that Chris Young was indeed the winning pitcher on June 25th.
1344	The statement "there was only one game played on May 20" is refuted by the table. According to the table, there were two games played on May 20: one between Texas and Houston (score of 7-3 in favor of Texas), and another game between other teams not mentioned in the table. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information in the table.
1345	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to Row 5 of the table, on June 24, 2005, the Houston Astros defeated the Texas Rangers with a score of 5-2. The winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt, and the losing pitcher was Ricardo Rodriguez, as stated in the table. Therefore, the statement "Ricardo Rodriguez was the losing pitcher during the game where the winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt" is supported by the table.
1346	Based on the information in the table, the statement is supported. Using the information in row 2, we can see that the game was played on May 20th, and the attendance was 38,109. Additionally, the winning team was Texas, and the winning pitcher was Kenny Rogers. Therefore, we can conclude that when the game attendance was 38,109, Kenny Rogers was indeed the winning pitcher.
1347	The statement "the winning pitcher on June 24 was Chris Young" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The winning team on June 24 was Houston, and the winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt, not Chris Young. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1348	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the game that occurred on May 20 was played in Arlington, not Houston. The winning team was Texas, and the score was 7-3. The winning pitcher was Kenny Rogers, and the losing pitcher was Brandon Backe. The attendance was 38,109, and the location was Arlington.
1349	According to the table, we can see that there are two games where Roy Oswalt and Brandon Backe played against each other: - May 20: Texas won 7 - 3, and the winning pitcher was Kenny Rogers, not Roy Oswalt, so we can't check if Brandon Backe was the losing pitcher or not.- June 25: Texas won 6 - 5, and the winning pitcher was Chris Young, not Roy Oswalt, but the losing pitcher was indeed Brandon Backe, which means that the statement "Brandon Backe is the losing pitcher when the winning pitcher is Roy Oswalt" is refuted by the table as there are no games where Roy Oswalt is the winning pitcher and Brandon Backe is the losing pitcher.
1350	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, Kenny Rogers was the winning pitcher for the Texas Rangers on May 20, 2005, when the attendance was 38109. Therefore, the statement "Kenny Rogers is the losing pitcher when attendance is 38109" is refuted by the table.
1351	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 11 shows that Titus Ozon was active from 1947 to 1964 and scored 157 goals, which matches the statement.
1352	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not have information for the years of 1950 through 1965, and it only represents the list of top association football goal scorers by country, without specifying a particular country or league. Therefore, it cannot support or refute the statement about the number of goals scored during the given time period.
1353	Supported. According to the table, James Burrows directed "Sex, Losers, and Videotape" for season 19 of "Will & Grace," which aired on April 3, 2003, with a US viewership of 15.0 million.
1354	The statement "for series 105 there were 15.8 million US viewers" is supported by the table. According to row 14 of the table, which corresponds to series 105 titled "Fagmalion Part II: Attack of the Clones," the episode had 15.8 million US viewers on January 30, 2003.
1355	Supported. According to the table, "All about Christmas Eve" was the title for episode 11 of season 5, which aired on December 12, 2002. Therefore, the statement "all about christmas eve was the title for season 11" is refuted by the table as it was an episode in season 5, not the title for season 11.
1356	The table only goes up to season 5, so we cannot determine whether series 101 is in season 10 based on the given table. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
1357	The statement is supported by the information in the table. "All About Christmas Eve" is indeed the title of the episode number 12, which was directed by James Burrows, written by Adam Barr, and originally aired on December 12, 2002, with a US viewership of 16.2 million.
1358	I'm sorry, but the statement "November 7, 2003 is the air date of the episode titled Boardroom and a parked place" is refuted by the table you provided. The table shows that the episode titled "Boardroom and a parked place" was aired on November 7, 2002, and not on November 7, 2003. Therefore, the statement is incorrect, and it is refuted by the information in the table.
1359	The statement is inaccurate or incomplete as per the information provided in the table. The series number for the episode number 10 of "Will & Grace (season 5)" is 101, not 103.0. The correct entry in the table is:|101 | 10 | The Honeymoon's Over | James Burrows | Sally Bradford | December 5, 2002 | 19.3 |
1360	The statement "Denis Menchov on the Rabobank team scored 40 UCI points" is supported by the table. In row 3, it shows that Denis Menchov, representing Russia and Rabobank team, scored 40 UCI points during the 2007 Volta a Catalunya with a time of +40.
1361	The statement "John Gadret on the AG2R Prevoyance team scored 15 UCI points" is supported by the given table as it can be observed from row 8 of the table that John Gadret, who is a French cyclist, is a member of the AG2R Prevoyance team and earned 15 UCI points in the 2007 Volta a Catalunya.
1362	The statement "Denis Menchov scored the most UCI points of any cyclists from Russia" is supported by the table. According to the table, Denis Menchov earned 40 UCI points during the 2007 Volta a Catalunya, which is the highest number of UCI points earned by any Russian cyclist listed in the table. Vladimir Karpets, who is also a Russian cyclist, earned 50 UCI points, but he is already listed in the table and his performance cannot be considered to compare with Menchov's in this statement. Therefore, the statement is true.
1363	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the team ag2r prévoyance cumulatively had more points than caisse d'epargne" is supported. According to the table, Ag2r Prévoyance had 45 points cumulative while Caisse d'Epargne had only 50 points.
1364	According to the table, there are three nations with one or zero gold medals and at least one silver medal:- United States- Russia- CzechoslovakiaThe total number of medals for United States with one silver and zero golds is 4, which is more than 2. Therefore, the statement "the total medals for the nation with 1 silver and 0 golds is more than 2" is supported by the table.
1365	Based on the information in the table, the statement "Katie Kansas coached one episode" is supported. The table shows that in season 13, episode 11, Shambre was made into a go-go dancer and was coached by Katie Kansas. This is reflected in the "coach" column of row 12 of the table. Therefore, Katie Kansas coached one episode of "Made" in the given season.
1366	Yes, the statement "thirteen is the only season listed" is supported by the table. All the episodes listed in the table are from the 13th season of the Made TV series. There is no other season mentioned in the table, so the statement is true based on the information provided.
1367	The statement "Rita is made into an actress is the title of episode five" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, episode 5 of the "Made" TV series is titled "Rita is made into an actress." Therefore, the statement is correct.
1368	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the coach for the 13th episode, titled "Ashley is made into a circus performer," is Rebecca Star. Therefore, the statement "in the episode with the coach Rebecca Star, Ashley is made into a circus performer" is supported by the information in the table.
1369	The statement "Katie Kansas was the coach in episode 10 premiered on October 11, 2012, and had a full episode external link" is supported by the information presented in the table. In row 11 of the table, it shows that Chris was made into a celebrity assistant on October 9, 2012, with BJ Coleman as the coach. In row 12, it shows that Shane was made into a Tough Mudder on October 10, 2012, with Chris as the coach. And in row 13, it shows that Shambre was made into a gogo dancer on October 11, 2012, with Katie Kansas as the coach. Additionally, the table indicates that each of these episodes had a full episode external link.
1370	The statement "Brian Patacca is the coach for episode 1 of season 13" is actually not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the coach for episode 1 of season 13 is Nikki Deloach. Brian Patacca is listed as the coach for episode 14, where Emilly and Jeanette are made into actresses. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1371	The statement is incorrect. The episode summary for episode five in the table states that "Rita is made into an actress," but the premier date of the episode is listed as June 25, 2012, not June 29, 2012. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1372	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not entirely correct. According to the information presented in the table, episode 11 premiered on October 10, 2012, not October 9, 2012. Additionally, the coach for that episode is named Chris, not Rebecca Star. Finally, the summary for that episode is "Shane is made into a Tough Mudder," rather than "Ashley is made into a circus performer." Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1373	The statement "the candidates were john j phillips (r) 57.6% vs n e west (d) 42.4%" is supported by the table. In the row for California 22, we see that John J Phillips was the Republican candidate, who won the election with 57.6% of the votes. N E West was the Democratic candidate, who lost the election with 42.4% of the votes.
1374	Based on the table provided, the statement "the Republican party had the first elected official in California in 1926" is unsupported. The table only provides information on the United States House of Representatives elections in California in 1942 and does not provide any information on the first election of a Republican official in California. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not the Republican party had the first elected official in California in 1926 based on this table.
1375	The statement is supported by the table. In every district where a Democrat held the seat before the 1942 United States House of Representatives elections (California 7, California 17, and California 10), the incumbent was re-elected and their party (Democratic) maintained the office.
1376	The statement "Alfred J Elliott was re-elected to California's 10th district in 1937" is supported by the table. Row 6 shows that Alfred J Elliott, the Democratic incumbent, was re-elected in California's 10th district in 1942, which means he would have been first elected in 1937 to serve his first term in the House of Representatives.
1377	The statement "California 22, a newly created district, resulted in a republican gain" is supported by the information presented in the table. In the table, it states that the district had no incumbent, no party, and no first elected representative since it was a new district. The result of the election for this district shows that John J. Phillips, a Republican candidate, won the election with 57.6% of the votes, while N.E. West, a Democratic candidate, received 42.4% of the votes. Therefore, the election resulted in a Republican gain in the newly created California 22 district.
1378	The statement "John J Phillips (R) 57.6% N E West (D) 42.4% are from the Democratic Party" is refuted by the information provided in the table. John J Phillips is listed as a Republican candidate, while N E West is listed as a Democratic candidate. Therefore, it is clear that John J Phillips is not from the Democratic Party.
1379	The statement is not accurate. According to the information in the table, Cecil R King was elected in the 17th district of California and not in the 10th district. Additionally, he was unopposed in the election, meaning he did not need to run against any other candidates. Therefore, the statement "the result with incumbent Cecil R King, district California 10 is re-elected" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1380	The statement is not supported by the table. While the table includes information about first elected, there is no district where the Democratic Party is listed as having been first elected in 1926. In fact, the information in rows 2-7 indicates that all the incumbents who were re-elected in 1942 were either Republicans or Democrats who had previously been elected in years ranging from 1926 to 1940. Additionally, in the new district created in California 22, the Republican candidate won the election, indicating that the Democratic Party did not have a historical advantage in that district.
1381	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not accurate based on the information presented in the table. While it is true that in California's 22nd district, there were only two candidates listed - John J Phillips (R) and N E West (D) - the vote percentages listed are 57.6% for Phillips and 42.4% for West. Therefore, there were two parties represented in the election in this district, not just one. It's worth noting, however, that the table only provides information for a select few of the house of representatives elections that took place in 1942. It's possible that the statement could be true for other districts that are not listed in this table.
1382	The statement you provided cannot be fully supported or refuted by the information in the table. While the table does show that the Republican Party won the election for California's 22nd district, which was a new district created in 1942, it does not provide information about the first election of the Republican Party in general.The table does show that Thomas Rolph, a Republican Party member, won the election for California's 4th district in 1942, but it does not provide information about whether that was the party's first election.Therefore, based on the information in the table, the statement about the Republican Party's first election cannot be fully supported or refuted.
1383	The statement is refuted by the information provided in the table. The table shows that John H. Tolan was the Democratic incumbent in California's 7th district and he was re-elected, meaning he retained his seat. Furthermore, there is no mention of a "new seat Republican gain" in relation to Tolan or any other candidate. The only mention of a new seat being created is in California's 22nd district, where the Republican candidate John J. Phillips won the election.
1384	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the attendance for week 8, which was played on October 22, 2000, was indeed 61603. Therefore, the statement is accurate and supported by the information in the table.
1385	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Cincinnati Bengals played against the Dallas Cowboys on November 12, 2000, with a result of "L 23 - 6". The attendance for that game was listed as "62170" in the table. Therefore, the statement that the attendance for the Bengals vs. Cowboys game was 62170 is supported by the information in the table.
1386	The statement is supported by the table. Week 8 is listed as "October 22, 2000" and the attendance is listed as "61603", which is the lowest attendance during the first 10 weeks of the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season.
1387	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in Week 11 of the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season, on November 12th, 2000, the Bengals played against the Dallas Cowboys with an attendance of 62,170. So, the statement is true and is supported by the table.
1388	The statement "Bruno Brandão from Brazil has a snatch of 157.0" is supported by the information presented in the table. In the table, under the "snatch" column, Bruno Brandão's weightlifting performance is recorded as 157.0 kg.
1389	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the person with a snatch of 153.0 is Christian López from Guatemala, and his bodyweight is listed as 104.7. Therefore, the statement "there is only one person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight is 104.70" is true based on the information in the given table.
1390	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, there is a row for Jose Espinoza, but the cells for the snatch and clean & jerk are left empty, indicated by "-". Therefore, we cannot confirm whether or not Jose Espinoza lifted 153.0 and 180.0 in the snatch and clean & jerk respectively, and there is no information provided regarding his bodyweight.
1391	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 4 of the table, on Sunday, September 30, 1951, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers 31-20 in Green Bay.
1392	Based on the information presented in the table provided, the statement "the Chicago Bears were the losers against the Green Bay Packers more than ten times" is supported. Out of the 21 games listed in the table, the Chicago Bears were the losing team in 11 of them, whereas the Green Bay Packers were the losing team in only 8 of them, and there were two ties. Therefore, the Bears lost more times than the Packers in the games listed in the table.
1393	The statement "Gene Borek is from the United States" is supported by the information in the given table. Gene Borek is listed in row 7 of the table with a score of 142 and a place of t6 (tied for 6th). The country column for Gene Borek reads "United States" indicating that he is from the United States.
1394	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, three players are tied for 3rd place, including Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller from the United States, and Bob Charles from New Zealand. Therefore, the statement "players from the United States and New Zealand are tied for 3rd place" is true based on the information in the table.
1395	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 3 of the table, Jim Colbert (the player in second place) has a score of 70 + 68 = 138.
1396	The statement "Johnny Miller placed T3" is supported by the information in the table. Johnny Miller's name appears on row 5, where he is tied with Jack Nicklaus and Bob Charles, all with a score of 140 and a to-par of -2. Therefore, Johnny Miller is indeed tied for 3rd place in the 1973 U.S. Open (golf), as indicated by his T3 designation in the table.
1397	The statement is supported by the table as it shows Tom Weiskopf as finishing tied for 6th place with a score of 142. Additionally, the country column for Weiskopf's entry in the table shows that he is from the United States.
1398	The statement "Bob Charles, from New Zealand, was tied for 3rd" is supported by the table. In row 6 of the table, it shows that Bob Charles from New Zealand had a score of 71 + 69 = 140, which was -2 to par. This ties him for 3rd place with Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller, who also had a score of 140. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1399	The statement is supported by the table. Jim Colbert appears in row 3, in the second position, with a score of "70 + 68 = 138," which is listed under the column "Score" and shows that he finished the tournament 4 shots behind Gary Player, who finished first. Therefore, the statement is accurate according to the information presented in the table.
1400	The statement "the player Gene Borek in T6 is from New Zealand" is refuted by the table. The player Gene Borek, as listed in the table, is from the United States.
1401	The statement "Arnold Palmer's place is T3" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Arnold Palmer's place is T6, which means he tied for the 6th place with a score of e (even par). Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1402	The statement is supported by the table. The row 7 of the table shows that Gene Borek finished tied for 6th place with a score of 77 + 65 = 142, and he belongs to the United States, as indicated in the "country" column of the table.
1403	The statement "the player from New Zealand is in last place" is refuted by the table. Bob Charles is tied for third place with Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller, all of whom have a total score of 140 and a score to par of -2. Therefore, Bob Charles is not in last place in the 1973 U.S. Open (golf).
1404	Sorry, the statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Jim Colbert from the United States is in second place with a score of 138, while the first-place Gary Player is from South Africa.
1405	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Gene Borek is listed as "t6" (tied for 6th place), and his country is mentioned as the United States. Additionally, his score is mentioned as "77 + 65 = 142," which is better than the score mentioned in the statement ("better than 77 + 65 = 142"). Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1406	The statement is not supported by the information presented in the table. Gene Borek is listed in row 7 in the table and is tied for 6th place with a score of 142. The three players tied for 3rd place in the tournament are Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, and Bob Charles, all with a score of 140.
1407	Supported. According to the table under the "Dartmouth - Princeton" row, it says that "90 games" were played for the series between Dartmouth and Princeton, which is consistent with the statement that "90 games were played for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy". However, it is worth noting that although there were 90 games played between the two teams, there is no mention of the sawhorse dollar trophy being awarded for this series, as it says "none" under the "trophy" column for the Dartmouth-Princeton matchup.
1408	Refuted. The table states that the series between Dartmouth and Princeton, which uses the sawhorse dollar trophy, played only 90 games since they first met in 1897. Therefore, the statement "more than 100 games were played for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy" is not supported by the information provided in the table.
1409	The statement "in the 2002 - 2003 season there were 6 cashes , a match play smaller than 13 and 7 events" is supported by the table. According to the table, in the 2002-03 season, there were 7 events, 6 cashes, and a match play of 2, which is smaller than 13.
1410	The statement "6 cashes has earnings of 39380" is supported by the table. Looking at the row that corresponds to 2011-12, we can see that the number of cashes is reported as 10. The earnings column for that row shows a value of 39380, which agrees with the earnings claimed in the statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1411	The statement is partially supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Paddock the toad's last appearance was indeed in "Blood is Thicker than Water" in the second season. However, the table indicates that multiple pairs of red squirrels appear in the second season, with their first and last appearances being in "A Hero's Welcome." Therefore, while some red squirrels may have made their last appearance in that episode, it cannot be said definitively that all of them did.
1412	According to the table, this statement is refuted. Row 9 of the table states that the male Bounder is named as having appeared in the books, thus indicating that he is present in the written version of the story. So the statement that the male Bounder in the books is no is not supported by the information in the table.
1413	The statement is not supported by the table. The table includes information about Jiří Novák's matches in Auckland, New Zealand, but the date listed is January 14, 1996, not October 10, 2004. Additionally, the surface listed for the Auckland match is hard, which contradicts the statement that the playing surface was not hard. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1414	According to the table, the surface for the match on October 10, 2004, which was played in Tokyo, Japan, was hard. Therefore, the statement "the surface for October 10, 2004 was hard" is supported by the information in the table.
1415	Yes, the statement "the surface for the opponent Roger Federer was clay" is supported by the table. In row 6 of the table, it can be seen that on July 13, 2003, Jiří Novák played against Roger Federer in Gstaad, Switzerland, and the surface for the match was clay.
1416	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the information in the table, the tournament that Jiří Novák played on October 10, 2004, was held on a hard surface in Tokyo, Japan. None of the tournaments listed in the table were held on a clay surface on October 10, 2004.
1417	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the match in which Roger Federer was the opponent was played at the "Gstaad, Switzerland" tournament on "clay" surface, not a carpet surface as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1418	The statement "the surface after October 10, 2004, was hard" cannot be confirmed or refuted by the table as there is no information about the surface of the tournaments Novak played after that date. The table only provides information about the date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score of Novak's matches up until November 3, 2004, and does not include any information about tournaments Novak played in after that date.
1419	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, the match between Jiří Novák and Roger Federer took place on July 13, 2003, in Gstaad, Switzerland, and the surface was clay.
1420	Based on the table, the statement is supported. Linfield was indeed the opponent, and the venue was "a", which likely means "away," indicating that the match was played in Linfield's home stadium.
1421	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Rangers played against Linfield on July 30, 2003, with a result of 3-0 in favor of Rangers. According to the table, the venue for this match was "a," which typically stands for "away." Therefore, the statement that the venue for the Rangers vs Linfield match was "b" is refuted by the table.
1422	The statement that "the killing (part two) originally aired on 9 November 1966" is supported by the table. In row 8 of the table, it can be seen that the episode titled "The Killing (Part Two)" was aired on 9 November 1966.
1423	The statement that "Jeremy Summers directed the episode written by Tony O'Grady (pseudonym of Brian Clemens)" is supported by the information presented in the table. Specifically, in row 13 of the table, it shows that Jeremy Summers directed episode 12, titled "The Maze," with a script credited to Tony O'Grady, who is indeed a pseudonym of Brian Clemens.
1424	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Episode 23 is titled "The Edge of Fear" and has a production number of 120, which matches the statement: "the production number for episode 23 is 120".
1425	The statement "during jul / aug 1966, storm warning (part one) was filmed" is supported by the information in the table. "Storm Warning (Part One)" is listed in the table under "filmed" as being recorded during "jul / aug 1966" (row 16).
1426	The statement "On 30 November 1966, the episode The Killing (Part Two) originally aired" is supported by the information in the table. As per the table, the episode "The Killing (Part Two)" is listed in row 8 with an original air date of 9 November 1966. Therefore, the statement stating that the episode "The Killing (Part Two)" aired on 30 November 1966 is incorrect.
1427	The statement is supported by the table as Row 12 shows that John Moxey directed the episode titled "The Maze", which was written by Tony O'Grady, who is a pseudonym of Brian Clemens.
1428	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the production number for Episode 23 is 120.
1429	The statement "On Jul/Aug 1966, There's Somebody Close Behind You was filmed" is supported by the information in the table. This information can be found in row 15 of the table where it says "There's Somebody Close Behind You" was directed by Roy Baker, written by Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, and originally aired on December 28, 1966. In the filmed column, it is stated that it was filmed in December 1965.
1430	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 in the table shows that Lorenzo Bandini, who drove for Ferrari, completed 105 laps and had a time of 2:06:18.23, which matches the time and number of laps mentioned in the statement. The column for "time / retired" states that he finished the race, as there is no indication of retirement. Row 3 in the table shows that Richie Ginther, who drove for BRM, also completed 105 laps, but his "time / retired" was "+ 6.18", indicating that he finished the race after Lorenzo Bandini. Therefore, the statement that "one grid has 105 laps and a time / retired of + 6.18" is supported by the information in the table.
1431	The statement is refuted by the table. While there is a driver who has completed 105 laps and has a time / retired of +6.18, which is Richie Ginther driving for BRM, he is not the only driver who has met this criteria. Therefore, the number of grids that have 104 laps and a time / retired of +6.18 is not 1.
1432	The statement "the CDR for the period 1975 - 1980 is 9.0 and the life expectancy is 61.5" is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at row 7 of the table, we can see that for the period 1975 - 1980:- The CDR (Crude Death Rate) per year is 1,043,000 (which corresponds to a CDR of 9.0 per 1,000 population, calculated as 1,043,000/3,741,000*1000).- The life expectancy at birth in total is 61.5 years (corresponding to a life expectancy of 59.2 years for males and 63.9 years for females).Therefore, the information in the table supports the statement that "the CDR for the period 1975 - 1980 is 9.0 and the life expectancy is 61.5".
1433	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not completely accurate based on the information in the table. According to the table provided, the period from 1995-2000 had an IMR (infant mortality rate) of 34 (rounded to the nearest whole number), but the life expectancy during this period was 69.3 years total, not the infant mortality rate. Therefore, the statement "in the period 1995-2000, the IMR is 34.0 and the life expectancy is 69.3" is partially correct, as the IMR is 34, but the life expectancy is 69.3 years, not the infant mortality rate.
1434	The statement "from 1990 - 1995, the cbr was 22.6 and the number of deaths per year was 1058000" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, in the row for the period from 1990-1995: - The CBR (crude birth rate) is given as 22.6, which matches the stated value in the statement. - The number of deaths per year is given as 1,058,000, which also matches the value stated in the statement.
1435	The statement "from 1965-1970, there were 998,000 deaths per year and 3,330,000 live births per year" is supported by the table. In row 5, it states that there were 3,330,000 live births per year and 998,000 deaths per year during the years 1965-1970.
1436	The statement "in the period 2000 - 2005, there was a TFR of 2.25 and an NC of 13.4" is supported by the table. According to row 12 of the table, during the period of 2000-2005, the Total Fertility Rate or TFR was 2.25, and the natural change or NC was 13.4. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information provided in the table.
1437	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the period from 1995 to 2000, there were 3,624,000 live births per year, and the life expectancy for females was 73.3 years. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information provided in the table.
1438	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The total life expectancy in 1950-1955 was 50.9 for males and 52.6 for females, which is less than 70.1. Additionally, the crude death rate (cdr) in 1950-1955 was 15.5, which is less than 32.5.
1439	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. The life expectancy in 1995-2000 is actually 69.3 for the total population, which is greater than 61.5. Additionally, the infant mortality rate (IMR) for that period is 34 per 1000 live births and not exactly 27.
1440	The statement you provided is not accurate based on the data in the table. In the period where there were 1,086,000 deaths per year (2000 - 2005), the "cdr" or "crude death rate" is 6.4, not 22.6. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1441	The statement you provided, "in the period where there were 900,000 deaths per year, there were also 2,500,000 natural changes per year," is not supported by the table. Looking at the table, during the period when there were 900,000 deaths per year (from 1950-1955), the natural change was 1,672,000 per year, not 2,500,000. Please double-check your statement or clarify it if necessary.
1442	The statement "there was a tfr of 2.45 in the period where the imr was 43" is supported by the table. According to the table, the tfr (total fertility rate) was 2.45 during the period of 1995-2000 (row 11) and the imr (infant mortality rate) was 43 during the same period. Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the data presented in the table.
1443	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the data presented in the table, there were 3,741,000 live births per year in the period from 1975 to 1980, which is slightly higher than the number stated in the statement. Therefore, this statement is refuted by the table.
1444	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table as it contains some errors:1. There are no "nil" (zero) entries for the party affiliations, administrative panel, or any of the other panels.2. The table does not have any rows that show all the conditions mentioned in the statement simultaneously to check if that specific case exists or not. Therefore, we cannot determine if the statement is true or false based on the table provided.
1445	The statement is supported by the table. Jose Ortiz is listed in row 3 of the table as "puerto rico| center| 1988 - 90| oregon state," confirming that he played for the Utah Jazz during those years as a center and attended Oregon State University. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1446	The statement "Andre Owens was the Houston Jazz club guard from 2005 - 06" is not supported by the table. The table provides a row for Andre Owens as a United States guard who played for the Utah Jazz from 2005-06, but there is no indication of a Houston Jazz club in the table. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the given table.
1447	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table. The table lists the names and information of several players who have played for the Utah Jazz basketball team during different years; it does not provide any information about a jazz club in Houston during the 2005-06 school year. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is any other way I can assist you.
1448	The statement "Dan O'Sullivan plays center for the Fordham Jazz club" is supported by the table, specifically the information presented in row 5, which states that Dan O'Sullivan is a center who played for the Utah Jazz in 1990-91 and attended Fordham.
1449	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Greg Ostertag played the center position for the Jazz from 1995 to 2004 and then from 2005 to 2006. Row 4 of the table shows his name, nationality, position, and the years he played for the Jazz.
1450	The statement "Greg Ostertag played center and went to Kansas" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Greg Ostertag is listed as a center who played for the Utah Jazz from 1995-2004 and 2005-06. In the "school/club team" column, it is indicated that he attended Kansas before joining the Jazz. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1451	The statement is refuted by the table. The table indicates that Greg Ostertag, the United States center, played for the Jazz from 1995-2004, and then again in the 2005-06 season. The table also indicates that Josã Ortiz was the Puerto Rican center who played for the Jazz from 1988-90, while Dan O'Sullivan was the American center who played for the Jazz in the 1990-91 season. Therefore, the statement that Greg Ostertag went to Oregon State and played for the Jazz from 1988-90 is not supported by the table.
1452	The statement is not supported by the table as it shows that Andre Owens played as a guard for the Utah Jazz from 2005-06. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1453	The statement is not supported by the table. While the table includes a player who played for the Jazz from 2005-06 and a player who graduated from Houston, there is no player from Turkey on the team who fits that description. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1454	The statement "Dan O'Sullivan went to Kansas and played the center position" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Dan O'Sullivan played center for the Utah Jazz in 1990-91, but he did not attend the University of Kansas. Instead, the "school/club team" column for him is listed as "Fordham," indicating that he played college basketball at Fordham University. Therefore, the statement that Dan O'Sullivan went to Kansas is false.
1455	The statement seems to be supported by the table. According to the table, Mehmet Okur played for the Utah Jazz as a "forward-center" from 2004-11, and his club team prior to joining the Jazz was Efes Pilsen in Turkey. Therefore, it can be inferred that Okur played the position of center during his time with Efes Pilsen.
1456	According to the table, there are multiple seasons where the divisional gap (gb) was 5. However, there is no mention of any correlation between the divisional gap and the average win percentage. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether or not the statement is supported or refuted by the table provided.
1457	According to the table, there is only one season with a GB of 5, which is the 2010 season. The win percentage for this season was 0.535, which is exactly the same as the average win percentage as mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1458	I'm sorry, but I cannot verify that statement using the table you provided. The table shows data about the Nashville Sounds' seasons, including the win percentage for each season, but it does not include information about seasons with a "gb of 5". Without knowing what "gb" means in this context, I cannot verify or refute the statement in question based on the information in the table. Please provide more context or clarification for "gb", or a different statement to check against the table.
1459	The table does not provide the complete required data to confirm or refute the statement. The table shows that the 2011 Nashville Sounds season had a win percentage of 0.493, but it does not show win percentages of other seasons with a gb of 5. Therefore, it is not possible to tell if the statement is supported or refuted by the information present in the table alone.
1460	The statement "the fourth elected incumbent Sidney R Yates was in 1964" is supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that Sidney R Yates was the incumbent for Illinois 9 and was re-elected in the 1974 House of Representatives election, running unopposed. According to the table, Sidney R Yates was first elected to the position in 1964, which matches the year in the statement.
1461	According to the table, the statement is partially true. While Sidney R. Yates was indeed elected in 1964, he was not the incumbent from the Republican Party. In fact, Yates was a Democrat and the incumbent of Illinois' 9th district. In 1964, Yates was re-elected as representative of Illinois' 9th district, and he ran unopposed as shown in row 5 of the table. There is no mention of him being elected in Illinois' 10th district, as claimed in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1462	The statement is supported by the table. Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, as shown in row 4 of the table where Leanne Baker was the runner-up against Mirielle Dittmann in that final.
1463	The statement "on 2 May 1999, the surface was hard" is supported by the table. Row 1 of the table shows that the outcome was a win for Leanne Baker, the date was 2 May 1999, the location was Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, the surface was hard, the opponent in the final was Candice Jairala, and the score was 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Therefore, the information in the table confirms that the surface was indeed hard on that particular date.
1464	The statement that "the opponent in final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on hard surface was Katerina Kramperová" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Leanne Baker was the runner-up in the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, and her opponent in that final was Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperová. The score of the match was 6-7 (5) 6-1 6-7 (5), as shown in Row 4 of the table.
1465	The statement "the surface was grass on 2 may 1999" is refuted by the table, as the surface listed for the match on May 2, 1999, is hard, not grass. The surface listed under "location" for that match is Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, and under "surface," the table shows "hard."
1466	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Volume 5 had 4 episodes and was released on September 19, 2006, which matches the information in the statement. Additionally, the table shows that September 19, 2006, relates to Region 1, which further supports the statement.
1467	The statement "the highest number of discs released for any of the volumes is only 1" is supported by the table. As we can see from the table, each volume has only one disc. So, the highest number of discs released for any of the volumes is indeed 1.
1468	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the information in row 6 of the table, the 5th volume has a volume number of 5, one disc, and 4 episodes. Additionally, the table shows that the 5th volume was released in region 1 on September 19th, 2006, which matches the date provided in the statement.Therefore, the statement "the 5th volume was released in region 1 on September 19th, 2006, there were 4 episodes" is supported by the information in the table.
1469	Based on the information in the provided table, the statement "the maximum number of discs is 1" is true. This is because in every row of the table, the value in the "discs" column is 1, indicating that every release consisted of only one disc.
1470	The statement "on March 15, 2007, and in region 4, the highest number of episodes was 4" is supported by the table. In row 1, we have the column named "Region 4", and in row 2 under that column, it shows "March 15, 2007". Moreover, in the same row, under the "Episodes" column, it shows "4", indicating that the highest number of episodes on that date and in that region was 4.
1471	Refuted. The table shows that on March 13, 2008, there were 3 volumes (3, 4, and 5) available in Region 4, each containing 4 episodes. However, the table does not specify which episodes were included in each volume, so we cannot determine if the statement "there were four episodes in region 4 on march 13, 2008" is true or false.
1472	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the volume with 1 disc, 4 episodes, and a region 1 release date of May 30, 2006, is volume 3, not volume 5. Volume 5 has a region 1 release date of September 19, 2006, which is different from the release date mentioned in the statement.
1473	Based on the table you provided, the statement "the volume's 2, 4, and 5 have 2 discs and 3 episodes" is refuted. The table shows that volumes 2 through 5 each have only 1 disc and 4 episodes.
1474	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the region 1 episode that aired in September aired in region 2 earlier" cannot be determined. The table provides information on the release dates for different volumes of a series in different regions, but it does not provide any information on specific episodes or their air dates.
1475	The statement "there is more than one disc" cannot be supported or refuted by the table as it only provides information about the number of volumes, episodes and release dates in different regions for a particular series, but it does not mention anything about the number of discs. We need additional information or a different table which specifically indicates the number of discs to confirm or refute the statement.
1476	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, on March 15, 2007, the release was in Region 4, and not Region 2. Additionally, the number of episodes released on that date was 1, as indicated by the "episodes" column of the table. The highest number of episodes released for any row in Region 2 is 4, on June 4, 2007, which is indicated in row 3 of the table.
1477	The statement is supported by the table. In row 7 of the table, it shows that in 1996, VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 24 - 9 and was seeded 12th in the southeast region. They lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 5th seed Indiana Hoosiers with a score of 51 - 58.
1478	The statement is accurate in terms of the win-loss record for the 2012 and 2013 VCU Rams men's basketball seasons, as presented in the table. The 2012 season had a record of 29 wins and 7 losses, which is the highest number of wins in any of the years presented in the table. The 2013 season had a record of 27 wins and 9 losses, which is the second-highest number of wins in any of the years presented in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1479	The statement is supported by the table. According to the "results" column of the table, in 2011, VCU Rams men's basketball team played in the Southwest region and won a total of 5 games and lost 1 game. The table also shows that their overall record for that year was 28-12, which matches the statement's claim.
1480	The statement "In 1980, the east region results were a loss of 72-86 from a seed 12 plus the year was smaller than 1996" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the row for the year 1980 shows that VCU Rams Men's Basketball team had a record of 18 - 12, a seed of 12 in the East Region, and their result was a loss of 72-86. Also, the row for the year 1980 has a lower year value compared to the row for the year 1996, which implies that the year 1980 was smaller than 1996.
1481	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the first row of the table, it shows that in the year 1980, the VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 18-12, which is exactly what the statement says. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1482	The statement is refuted by the table. The best record listed in the table is 28-12, which was achieved in 2011, and not in 2012. However, the table does show that they received an even lower seed of 11 in that year. So, the statement partially correct in mentioning that they received a low seed, but not correct in mentioning the year and the best record.
1483	The statement is mostly correct; however, there is a minor error in the last outcome. Instead of "i 62-70," it should be "l 62-70." Therefore, the corrected statement is "w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70 results has a record of 27-9." This statement is supported by the table as it includes the games and results for the 2011 season and the record listed in the last row of the table corresponds to a record of 27-9.
1484	The statement is partially supported by the table. The row that includes "l 72 - 86" results matches the criteria of having a seed less than 12. However, the year associated with that row is 1980, which is earlier than the condition of the year being larger than 1996. Therefore, while the seed condition is met, the year condition is not, so the statement is not fully supported by the table.
1485	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table. The table shows that in 1980, VCU Rams Men's Basketball finished with a record of 18-12, which is consistent with the statement. However, the table shows that they received the 12 seed for the East region, not the 11 seed as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table as it does not accurately reflect the information presented in the table.
1486	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that in 1996, VCU Rams Men's Basketball team had a record of 24 - 9 and were the 12 seed of the southeast region. They lost in the first round of the tournament to the 5th seed, the University of Illinois Fighting Illini, with a score of 51 - 58. Therefore, the statement "in 1996 they were the 2 seed of the southeast region" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1487	The statement "Fox Mulder won Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1996" is supported by the given table. As indicated in row 2 of the table, David Duchovny won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series in 1996 for his portrayal of Fox Mulder on The X-Files.
1488	The statement "In 1997, David Duchovny was nominated for the best actor in a leading role" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 5 of the table, David Duchovny was nominated for the best actor in a leading role - drama series in 1997 for his role as Fox Mulder in The X-Files.
1489	The statement is partially supported by the table. The earliest year in the table is indeed 1996, but the role/episode column for David Duchovny mentions "David Duchovny" instead of "Fox Mulder". However, it's worth noting that David Duchovny played the character of Fox Mulder, so it could be argued that the statement is still supported.
1490	The statement "it is 1998 when the role / episode is David Duchovny" is not supported or refuted by the information presented in the table. The table lists the awards and nominations received by The X-Files in different categories from 1996 to 2000, and it includes information such as the year, the category, the recipients and nominees, the role/episode, and the result. However, there is no category or row in the table that specifically indicates the role or episode played by David Duchovny in 1998. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm or refute the statement about the role/episode based on the information provided in the table.
1491	The statement is supported by the table. Row 6 of the table states that Zoë Wanamaker played the character Ariadne Oliver in episodes 10-13 of the Poirot TV series, which aired from 2006-2013. Therefore, the statement "zoë wanamaker plays the character ariadne oliver" is true based on the information presented in the table.
1492	The statement "the actor of the character Ariadne Oliver is Hugh Fraser" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the actor who played the character of Ariadne Oliver is Zoe Wanamaker, not Hugh Fraser. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1493	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 5 of the table, the incumbent for Maryland district 6 was Goodloe Byron and he was re-elected, defeating the Republican candidate Elton R Wampler with a vote percentage of 73.7%.
1494	The statement "Robert Bauman was the incumbent for Maryland District 1" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Robert Bauman was listed as the incumbent for Maryland District 1 in 1974, as he was re-elected with 53.0% of the votes. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1495	The statement "Robert Bauman was the Republican incumbent who won the race in 1973" is supported by the information presented in the table. In the first row of the table, under the column "Incumbent," the name "Robert Bauman" appears, and under the column "Result," it says that he was "re-elected." The party column also shows that he was affiliated with the Republican party. The table further shows that the election he won was in Maryland's 1st Congressional district, and the year of the election was indeed 1974 (Maryland's representatives were elected for a term beginning in 1975). Therefore, it can be concluded that Robert Bauman was the Republican incumbent who won the race in the 1974 United States House of Representatives elections for Maryland's 1st Congressional district.
1496	The statement "Parren Mitchell was re-elected for Maryland district 7 in 1970" is supported by the provided table. In the table, under row 6, it states that Parren Mitchell, a Democrat running for Maryland district 7, was re-elected in 1970 and was unopposed. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1497	The statement is supported by the table, specifically in row 5 where it shows that Goodloe Byron, the incumbent politician for Maryland district 6, won the 1974 United States House of Representatives election with 73.7% of the vote against Elton R Wampler, who was the Republican candidate.
1498	The statement "there is only 1 instance where Robert Bauman is the incumbent politician" is supported by the table. As we can see from the table, Robert Bauman is listed as the incumbent politician for the Maryland 1 district. All the other incumbent politicians listed in the table are different than Robert Bauman. Therefore, the statement is true.
1499	The statement "Robert Bauman is the incumbent for the Republican party" is supported by the table. We can see in row 2 that Robert Bauman, a Republican, was the incumbent for Maryland district 1, and he was re-elected in the 1974 United States House of Representatives elections.
1500	The statement "the result for the voting district of Maryland 7 is re-election of the incumbent" is supported by the information in the table. In row 6 of the table, it shows that Parren Mitchell, the incumbent for Maryland 7, was re-elected in the 1974 United States House of Representatives election and was, in fact, unopposed. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1501	The statement "Maryland district 6 candidate Elton R Wampler succeeded incumbent candidate Goodloe Byron" is refuted by the information in the table. The table shows that Goodloe Byron, the incumbent Democratic candidate, was re-elected in Maryland's 6th district with 73.7% of the vote. Elton R Wampler, the Republican candidate, received 26.3% of the vote and was not successful in defeating Byron. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1502	The statement that "Thomas J. Hatem was the incumbent candidate for Maryland District 1" is supported by the table. In the table, it shows that Robert Bauman, the incumbent Republican candidate, was re-elected in Maryland District 1 with 53.0% of the vote, while Thomas J. Hatem was the Democratic candidate who lost the election with 47.0% of the vote. Therefore, Thomas J. Hatem was the challenger in the election, not the incumbent.
1503	I'm sorry, but the statement that "parren mitchell was re-elected for the district Maryland 8" cannot be supported or refuted by the table you provided. The table only shows data for districts 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 of Maryland. There is no information about the 8th district, so we cannot confirm or deny whether Parren Mitchell was re-elected in that district.
1504	The statement that "the candidates for the Maryland district 7 were incumbent Goodloe Byron and Elton R Wampler" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the incumbent for the Maryland district 7 was Parren Mitchell, who ran unopposed and was re-elected. Therefore, Goodloe Byron and Elton R Wampler were not candidates for the Maryland district 7 in the 1974 United States House of Representatives elections.
1505	The statement is incorrect. The table shows that Robert Bauman was the incumbent for Maryland District 1, not District 2. So, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1506	The statement "Robert Bauman is the Democratic incumbent for Maryland District 7" is false and refuted by the table. In the table, Robert Bauman is listed as the Republican incumbent for Maryland District 1, not District 7. Additionally, the table shows that he was re-elected in 1974 with 53% of the vote, defeating Thomas J. Hatem, who ran as a Democrat. Therefore, it can be concluded from the table that Robert Bauman is a Republican incumbent, not a Democratic incumbent, and he was elected in the first district, not the seventh.
1507	The provided statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland's 7th congressional district, but he was unopposed, which means he did not need to defeat Elton R. Wampler or any other candidate to win. Therefore, the statement that Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland District 7 defeating Elton R. Wampler is not accurate based on the information in the table.
1508	Based on the information in the table, the statement "on May 31st David Lelay (FRA) was the series leader" is supported. The table shows that on May 31st, the Grand Prix de Plumelec - Morbihan race was won by Thomas Voeckler (FRA) while riding for Bouygues Telecom team, but the series leader was David Lelay from Bretagne - Armor Lux team, who had previously won the Trophée des Grimpeurs on May 4th, 2008.
1509	The statement "on October 9 Jérôme Pineau was the series leader" is supported by the information in the table.  According to row 15 of the table, the winner of the Paris-Bourges race on October 9 was Bernhard Eisel, but the series leader at the time was Jérôme Pineau, as stated in the "series leader" column in rows 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information provided in the table.
1510	The statement "series leader David Lelay (FRA) was also the winner for the Tour du Haut Var" is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Davide Rebellin from Italy was the winner of the Tour du Haut Var, and Rinaldo Nocentini from Italy was the series leader after that event. David Lelay from France did not appear to compete or win the Tour du Haut Var in 2008, according to the table.
1511	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Bernhard Eisel (Aut) is the winner of the Paris-Bourges event on October 9th, and Jérôme Pineau (Fra) is listed as the series leader at that time. Therefore, Jérôme Pineau did not win the October 9th event.
1512	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in a match between Panathinaikos and Standard Liege, in the first leg, Team 1, Panathinaikos, scored 1 goal while Team 2, Standard Liege, scored 3 goals.
1513	The statement is supported by the table. In row 9, Werder Bremen is in Team 2 and the score in the 2nd leg against Valencia was indeed 4-4, resulting in a total aggregate score of 5-5.
1514	The statement is refuted by the table. Standard Liège is not listed as one of the teams playing against Hamburg in the provided table. Therefore, the statement that Standard Liège had a match against Hamburg as Team 1 is not supported by the information in the table.
1515	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the second leg score for the match with Werder Bremen is 4-4, while the first leg score is 1-1. Therefore, the second leg score is actually greater than the first leg score, and the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1516	The statement is supported by the table. In row 7, it shows that the first leg score for the match between Panathinaikos as Team 1 and Liverpool as Team 2 was indeed 1-0 in favor of Liverpool.
1517	Yes, the statement "the match with opponent Cleber Luciano lasted 7:57" is supported by the table. According to row 13, Fabiano Iha fought Cleber Luciano at EC 22 - Extreme Challenge 22, and the match ended in a win for Fabiano Iha by KO in the first round. The time of the match is also listed in the table as 7:57.
1518	The statement "tko (cut) was the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event" is supported by the table. In row 12 of the table, we can see that Fabiano Iha lost the fight against Laverne Clark, with the method of "tko (cut)" in the first round of the "UFC 20" event, which corroborates the statement.
1519	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Fabiano Iha participated in the UFC 20 event and his fight ended with a method of TKO (cut). Thus, the statement "the UFC 20 event ended with a method of decision (unanimous)" cannot be supported by the table.
1520	The statement "the player from Portugal is ranked number 1" is supported by the table. According to the table, row 2 shows that Pedro Fraga and Nuno Mendes, representing Portugal, finished in first place with a time of 6:39.07, which is the fastest time among all the rowers. Therefore, the statement that the player from Portugal is ranked number 1 is true.
1521	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table provided, the rower(s) ranked sixth is Jang Kang-eun and Kim Hong-kyun from South Korea. The notes in the last column indicate "sc/d," which likely means that they advanced to the Semi-finals C/D. Therefore, the statement that the player ranked sixth is from South Korea and the notes indicate sc/d is supported by the information in the table.
1522	I'm sorry, but I cannot verify that statement as it lacks any value to compare it with the data in the table. Please provide me a comparable value, and I'll let you know if it is supported or refuted by the information in the table.
1523	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. As we can see in row 4 of the table, Japan is the country, and the notes show "sc/d". Additionally, since Japan's ranking is third (which is indeed greater than four), the statement is true for this specific row.
1524	The statement "Iran, who ranks 1st in GDP in the Middle East, ranks sixth in all of Asia" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Iran has a GDP (PPP) of 930.236 billion USD, which ranks it first among Middle Eastern countries and sixth among Asian countries.
1525	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Iraq had a GDP (PPP) of 127.348 billion USD in 2011, which is listed in row 8. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1526	The statement "Israel had a GDP (PPP) (billions of USD) of 235.446 in 2011" is confirmed by the information presented in the table. In row 5, we can see that Israel is ranked 4th among the Asian and Pacific countries listed, with a GDP (PPP) of 235.446 billion USD in 2011. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1527	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Iran is ranked 1 in the Middle East and 6 in Asia based on their GDP (PPP) in 2011.
1528	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not accurate. According to the table, Iran was listed in row 2 and had a 2011 GDP (PPP) of 930.236 billion USD. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table, as Iran's 2011 GDP (PPP) was much higher than 261.189 billion USD.
1529	I'm sorry, but the statement "qatar is ranked 8th in the middle east for GDP" is actually refuted by the table. According to the table, Qatar is ranked 5th in the Middle East for GDP (PPP), with a value of 181.912 billion USD in 2011. The countries that ranked higher than Qatar in the Middle Eastern region are: Iran, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Kuwait.So, the statement "qatar is ranked 8th in the middle east for gdp" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1530	The statement is actually incorrect. According to the table, Israel's GDP (PPP) in billions of USD in 2011 was 235.446 and it is ranked 4th in the list. Therefore, the statement "Israel has a GDP of 36.897" is refuted by the table.
1531	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at the first column of the table, we can see that Iran is ranked number 1 in the Middle East region for GDP (PPP), which is the lowest rank compared to other Middle Eastern countries listed in the table. Therefore, the statement "Iran has the lowest Middle East rank" is supported by the table.
1532	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the first column lists the ranking of the countries in the Middle East, the second column lists the ranking of the countries in Asia, and the third column lists the ranking of the countries in the world. We can see that there is only one Middle Eastern country listed in the table, which is Iran, and it is ranked number 1 in the Middle East. There is also only one Asian country listed in the table, which is Israel, and it is ranked number 19 in Asia. Therefore, the statement that "there is 1 mideast rank and 1 asian rank" is supported by the information presented in the table.
1533	The statement is refuted by the table. The Netherlands had one gold medal and a rank of 2 in the 1967 world judo championships. The statement specifically mentions that there are no countries that have 1 gold and a rank smaller than 2, but the table indicates that the Netherlands had 1 gold medal and a rank of 2. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1534	That statement is supported by the table. As per the table, South Korea did not win any gold medal in the 1967 world judo championships. Their total medal count was 3, which included 1 silver and 2 bronze medals.
1535	The statement "there are no countries that have 4 bronze medals" is supported by the information presented in the table for the 1967 world judo championships. As we can see from the table, the maximum number of bronze medals that any country received was two. Therefore, no country received four bronze medals in this championship.
1536	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, South Korea did not win any gold medals, but won one silver and two bronze medals, totaling three medals.
1537	I'm sorry, but that statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the team ranked fifth has won one silver and two bronze medals, not one silver and one bronze as claimed in the statement. Therefore, the statement is inaccurate in terms of the number of medals won by the fifth-ranked team in the FIVB Volleyball World League.
1538	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table:- The rank 7 has a total of 2 medals (1 gold and 1 bronze).- The bronze medals for rank 7 is 1. So, the statement "the total for the rank 7 is 2 and the bronze is 1" is true according to the information presented in the table.
1539	The statement you provided is supported by the table. The table shows that in row 8, the rank 7 team has a total of 1 gold and 0.33 silver medals. Therefore, they have a sum of total for gold less than 1 and silver of 3, which confirms the statement you made.
1540	The statement "the years 1972 - 1976 have a rank of 1" is supported by the information in the table because according to row 2, the player Jim Nowers played from 1972 to 1976 and has a rank of 1, which corresponds to his position as the player with the highest number of total rebounds. Therefore, the years 1972 - 1976 have a rank of 1 in terms of the player who played during that time period and had the highest number of total rebounds according to this table.
1541	The statement is supported by the information in the given table. The maximum rebounds recorded in a single season is recorded in the "total rebounds" column of the first row, which has a value of 1048. Therefore, none of the players listed in the table have recorded more than 1048 rebounds in a single season.
1542	The statement "the total rebounds of player Herb Estes are 734" is supported by the table. In row 9 of the table, it says that Herb Estes played from 1973-1976, averaged 9.2 rebounds per game, and had a total of 734 rebounds. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information provided in the table.
1543	The statement is supported by the information in the table. We can see that Jai Lewis has a rebound average of 7.2, he played 125 games, and he is ranked 7th. Therefore, the data in the table confirms the statement.
1544	The statement "no other game have total rebounds smaller than 1048" cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. The table lists the top 10 players in terms of total rebounds, but it does not provide information about the total rebounds of all other games.It's also worth noting that the statement itself is somewhat unclear. If the statement means that no other player in this particular game has a total number of rebounds lower than 1048, then the table does provide evidence to refute it, since there are a number of players listed in the table with lower total rebound numbers. However, if the statement means that no other basketball game in history has had a total number of rebounds lower than 1048, then the table does not provide enough information to support or refute the claim.
1545	The statement is supported by the information in the table. As we can see, George Evans has a total of 953 rebounds, which is fewer than all of the players ranked above 8. Therefore, there are zero rebounds with George Evans as a player and a rank larger than 8.
1546	The statement "Herb Estes has 708 rebounds" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Herb Estes had a total of 734 rebounds during his career, which is more than the stated number. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1547	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table as there is no player in the table with both more than 124 games and a rank of 10. The player with the 10th rank in the table is Jesse Young with a rebound average of 6.2 and a total of 708 rebounds, but he played only 115 games, which is less than 124 games. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the information present in the table.
1548	The statement "Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24, 108 - 111 (OT)" is supported by the table. The table shows that Toronto played Cleveland on November 24, and Toronto lost to Cleveland with a score of 108-111, which went into overtime. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1549	The statement is refuted by the table. The result of the game on November 20 in Dallas was actually a loss for the Toronto Raptors, with a score of 99 - 105 (OT).
1550	The statement is supported by the table. According to row six of the table, Isabel Cueto's opponent in the final on July 9, 1990, was Barbara Paulus, and she won the match 6-2, 6-3. Therefore, the statement is true and is supported by the information in the table.
1551	The statement is supported by the table because we can see that on August 1, 1988, at a tournament in Athens, Greece, Isabel Cueto played against Laura Golarsa in the final and the surface was clay. Row number 3 of the table mentions the following details:    "1 August 1988| Athens, Greece| clay| Laura Golarsa| 6-0, 6-1" Therefore, it is evident that both players played on a clay surface in the final match.
1552	The statement is supported by the table. The row 5 of the table shows that Isabel Cueto played against Katerina Maleeva in the final of Sofia, Bulgaria tournament, and the score of the match was indeed 6-2, 7-6(3).
1553	The statement "9 july 1990 was the date the opponent in the final was katerina maleeva" is not supported by the information in the given table. The opponent of Isabel Cueto in the final match on July 9th, 1990, was Barbara Paulus, as stated in the table: "9 july 1990| palermo, italy| clay| barbara paulus| 6 - 2 , 6 - 3".
1554	I apologize, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Isabel Cueto played against Katerina Maleeva in the final of a tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria on July 31, 1989, and won with a score of 6-2, 7-6 (3). Thus, the statement that "6 - 2 , 7 - 5 was the score for the opponent against katerina maleeva in the final" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1555	The statement "the teams with 3 losses have 0 ties" is neither supported nor refuted by the information presented in the table. Looking at the table, we can see that all four teams have the same number of ties, which is 0. However, the statement does not address the number of teams with 3 losses. Therefore, we cannot determine if the statement is true or false based on the information provided in the table.
1556	The statement "the game against opponent buffalo sabres had an attendance of 10750" is refuted by the table. As per the table, the game against the Buffalo Sabres had an attendance of 15,611, which is different from the attendance mentioned in the statement. The correct attendance figure can be found in row 12 of the table, where the attendance for the game against Buffalo Sabres is recorded as 15,611, not 10,750 as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1557	Yes, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 15 of the table states that the episode "Princess Party" was directed by Michael Spiller and written by Elaine Ko. Therefore, the episode that Elaine Ko wrote was indeed directed by Michael Spiller.
1558	The statement is supported by the table. Row 4 of the table shows that the episode with the production code of 2arg01, titled "Earthquake," was originally aired on October 6, 2010.
1559	Supported - According to the table, "Halloween" is the title of the episode with the production code of 2arg09. Row 6 of the table shows that "Halloween" is the title, and the production code is 2arg09.
1560	The statement is supported by the table. The row 23 in the table shows that the episode titled "See You Next Fall" has the production code of 2arg24 and it was originally aired on May 18, 2011. Therefore, the statement is correct.
1561	The statement "Halloween has production code 2arg09 and was number 47 in the series" is incorrect. The correct production code of the Halloween episode in season 2 of Modern Family is 2ARG06, as listed in row 6 of the table. Also, Halloween was the sixth episode of season 2, and not the 47th episode. Therefore, this statement is refuted by the information presented in the provided table.
1562	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the episode with the production code 2arg24 titled "See You Next Fall" was actually directed by Steven Levitan, not Michael Spiller.
1563	The statement "the production code for see you next fall is 2arg01" is not supported by the table. The production code for "See You Next Fall" is listed as 2arg24 in the table.
1564	Based on the information in the table, we can see that the statement is refuted. Chris DiMarco has zero wins in all four major tournaments despite having top-25 finishes in all of them. He has one top-5 finish in the Masters Tournament and top-10 finishes in all four major tournaments. Therefore, the statement "there are no wins when the top 25 and even the top 10 are less than 4" is not supported by the data in the table.
1565	Looking at the table, we can see that the statement refers to the PGA Championship section. In the row for the PGA Championship, we can see that the top-25 count is 4 or more - it is  13. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1566	That statement is supported by the table. In row 7 of the table, the away team is Essendon, and the crowd size is recorded as 28158. This indicates that when Essendon played against Geelong at Kardinia Park on July 31st, 1954, the crowd size was 28158.
1567	The statement "the size of the crowd when Essendon was the away team was 25158" is not supported by the table. The correct crowd figure for the Essendon vs. Geelong game played on 31 July 1954 is 28158, as indicated in row 7 of the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1568	The table provided does not contain information about a game where Hawthorn was the home team, so the statement is neither supported nor refuted by the information presented in the table.
1569	The statement is supported by the table. The entry with a rating/share of 3.2/8, located in row 7, had 12.42 million viewers, which is more than the value stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1570	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Olimpia is in position 10 with 2 wins.
1571	The statement is supported by the table. The team positioned higher than 10 (which is Olimpia) scored a total of 10 goals throughout the season, while all the other teams scored more than 10 goals. Therefore, the total number scored of the team positioned higher than 10 is indeed zero, as the statement suggests.
1572	The statement that "the nation of Croatia won 3 medals all together, 2 of which were silver" is supported by the table. According to the table, Croatia won a total of 3 medals, 2 of which were silver. The table shows that Croatia did not win any gold medals, but won 2 silver and 1 bronze medal, giving them a total of 3 medals.
1573	The statement is supported by the table. Row 18 shows that Australia did not receive any gold medals at the 2003 world taekwondo championships. The table shows that Australia won only one bronze medal (represented by the "bronze" column) at the event.
1574	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Croatia received 0 gold medals, 2 silver medals, and 1 bronze medal with a total of 3 medals. Therefore, the statement "the nation of Croatia received less than 2 silver medals with a total medal of only 1" is false.
1575	According to the table, the statement "Australia received 0 gold medals and more than 1 bronze" is supported. Australia did not receive any gold medals, but they did receive 1 bronze medal.
1576	The statement is supported by the table. Episode 4 is listed as airing on June 8th, 2008, and it is the earliest episode number that aired on that date. Therefore, the statement is true.
1577	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, episode number 4, which aired on 8 June 2008, had 1.364 million viewers and was ranked 4th for that night, meaning it was not the least watched episode. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1578	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the Chicago Bears were the opponents on October 16, 1983" is supported. Row 7 of the table shows that the Detroit Lions played against the Chicago Bears on October 16, 1983, and won the game with a score of 31-17 in front of a crowd of 66,709.
1579	The statement "week 9 was on October 30, 1983" is supported by the information in the table. Week 9 is shown in row 10 of the table, and the date listed under "date" for that week is "October 30, 1983".
1580	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. The date for the opponent Chicago Bears was October 16, 1983, as shown in row 7 of the table. The date listed for the opponent of the Lions on December 5, 1983, was the New York Giants, as shown in row 10. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1581	The statement that "week 9 was before October 30, 1983" is contradicted by the information in the table. According to the table, Week 9 occurred on October 30, 1983, as indicated in Row 10 of the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the data in the table.
1582	The statement is supported by the table. Row 4 of the table shows that the Miami Heat played against the Washington Wizards on April 4, 2009, at the Verizon Center. The score was 118-104 (OT) in favor of the Miami Heat. The attendance at the game was 20173, and the Miami Heat's record after the game improved to 41-36. Therefore, the statement that Washington has a record of 41-36 and played at the Verizon Center with 20173 people in attendance is false; it was Miami that played at the Verizon Center with those attendance figures and that record.
1583	The statement is supported by the table. In row 3 of the table, it shows that the Miami Heat played against the Charlotte team on April 3, 2009. The score of the game was W 97-92 (OT), which means that Miami won the game in overtime with a score of 97 points while Charlotte scored 92 points. The table also shows that at the end of the game, Miami's record was 40-36, which means that they had 40 wins and 36 losses up until that point. Therefore, the statement "Charlotte improved to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in OT" is supported by the information provided in the table.
1584	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table. The table only provides information on the Miami Heat's games played during the 2008-2009 season and does not include any record of 49-36%. Additionally, none of the games listed in the table were played at the Verizon Center with an attendance of 20,173. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1585	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 3, the game against Charlotte, Michael Beasley was the highest scorer with 27 points, and the score was W 97-92 (overtime).
1586	The statement "Dylan Sprouse won in the category favorite TV actor for 2010 and 2011" is supported by the information in the table. Row 5 of the table shows that Dylan Sprouse won the 2010 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite TV Actor, and row 11 of the table shows that he also won the same award in 2011.
1587	The statement "both the 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards nominated Cole Sprouse for the Favorite TV Actor category" is true based on the information presented in the table. In both the 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards, Cole Sprouse was nominated for the Favorite TV Actor category.
1588	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, The Suite Life on Deck was nominated in the Teen Pick Show: Comedy category of the Hollywood Teen TV Awards in 2010 but did not win.
1589	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to row 4, Cole Sprouse was nominated for the "Favorite TV Actor" category in the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards. Additionally, according to rows 10 and 11, Cole Sprouse was also nominated for the "Favorite TV Actor" category in the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards. Therefore, the statement "neither the 2010 nor the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards nominated Cole Sprouse for the favorite TV actor category" is refuted by the table.
1590	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 8 of the table, on October 28, 2001, the St. Louis Rams played against the New Orleans Saints, and the attendance for that game was 66,189. The Rams had a record of 6-1 going into that game, which means that the statement "66189 people attended the new orleans saints game with a record of 6 - 1" is true based on the data presented in the table.
1591	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 17 of the table, the St. Louis Rams played against the Indianapolis Colts on December 30, 2001, and the attendance was recorded as 66084. Therefore, the statement "66084 people attended the Indianapolis Colts game on December 30, 2001" is supported by the table.
1592	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 8 of the table, on week 8 (October 28, 2001), the St. Louis Rams played the New Orleans Saints with a record of 6-1, and the attendance for the game was indeed 66,189 people. Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the attendance and record of the team for that specific game.
1593	The statement "3 - 2 was the result of the game with a score of 3 - 2" is supported by the table in row 3, which shows that the score for the game on February 17, 2008 was 3-2. The "result" column also confirms that the game ended with a score of 3-2, which is the same as the stated result. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1594	The statement "the score of the 2014 world cup qualification was 2 - 1" is partially supported by the table. According to the table, the match was played on June 8th, 2012 in Doha, Qatar, and the score was 2-1, as Kwak Tae-hwi's team won 4-1 in the 2014 World Cup qualification match. So, while the statement correctly identifies the score of the match, it has an incorrect year. Therefore, the statement is partially supported by the table.
1595	The statement is supported by the table, as the row with the score 4-1 shows a result of 4-1 in both the "score" and "result" columns, indicating that the aggregate result of the game was indeed 4-1. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1596	The statement is supported by the table. According to the second row in the table, the game with a score of 3-2 was played on February 17, 2008, and the venue was Chongqing, China.
1597	I apologize, but the statement you provided is a bit unclear. However, based on the information in the table, I can say that the statement is not supported. None of the matches listed in the table have a result of 3-2 while the score is 2-0. The closest match is on February 17, 2008, in which Korea Republic played against China in the 2008 East Asian Cup. The result was 3-2, which means that Korea Republic won by just one goal. The score, however, was not 2-0 at any point during the game. Instead, the score was 1-1 in the first half, and then Korea scored two more goals in the second half to secure the victory.
1598	The statement appears to be incorrect based on the information provided in the table. The table shows that there were two matches played during the 2010 World Cup Qualification, and neither of them was held in Seoul, South Korea. One match was played in South Korea on February 2, 2008, but its score was 1-0, not 2-1. The other match was played on October 15, 2008, in Seoul, South Korea, but its score was 4-1, not 2-1. Therefore, the statement that the score of the 2010 World Cup qualification was 2-1 and the venue was Seoul, South Korea is refuted by the table.
1599	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. None of the rows in the table show a score of 4-1 at a venue in London. The 4-1 score occurred on June 8, 2012, during the 2014 World Cup qualification at a venue in Doha, Qatar. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1600	The statement you provided is not supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the game with a score of 3 - 2 was held on February 17, 2008, in Chongqing, China. The venue was not London, but rather Chongqing, as stated in the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1601	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 4 of the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranks 3rd with a total cargo load of 2939157 metric tonnes.
1602	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, O'Hare International Airport is ranked 18th in total cargo with a metric tonnage of 1512186. So, the statement is partially correct but has a minor typographical error.
1603	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport is ranked as #3 in total cargo volume with 2,939,157 metric tonnes.
1604	The statement "rank 16 has a code (iata / icao) of ord / kord" is not supported by the information presented in the table. From the table, we can see that the airport listed at rank 16 is London Heathrow Airport, with the code (iata / icao) of LHR / EGLL. The code (iata / icao) of ORD / KORD belongs to O'Hare International Airport, which is listed at rank 18 in the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1605	The statement is supported by the table. In row 4, which corresponds to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the total cargo is listed as 2939157 metric tonnes, which is the highest total cargo amount among all the airports listed in the table with a rank greater than 4.
1606	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to row 29 of the table, Cologne Bonn Airport (CGN/EDDK) saw a 0.5% increase in total cargo traffic, which is consistent with the statement.
1607	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement that "Memphis International Airport had the most cargo shipped in and out" is refuted. According to the table, Hong Kong International Airport had the highest total cargo (metric tonnes) of 4,062,261, while Memphis International Airport had the second-highest total cargo of 3,916,535.
1608	The statement is supported by the table. Brian Finch has a rank of 7, which is greater than 3, and his finishing time was 2:14.59.0, as shown in row 8 of the table.
1609	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. Brian Finch is not part of the Suzuki team, and his team is listed as Velocette in the table. Additionally, he has a rank of 7, which is greater than 3. However, his team name doesn't match with any of the listed teams in the table. Also, his time value is indeed 2:14.59.0, but the rest of the statement is not applicable based on the given table.
1610	The statement "series number 54 was written by m scott veach & rebecca kirsch" is supported by the table. Row 10 in the table states that the series number 54 is "the queen's gambit job" and it was written by M. Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch.
1611	The statement "series number 50 has had 3.38 million viewers" is supported by the table. Based on the table provided, we can see that series number 50 is the sixth episode of season 3 titled "The Carnival Job". The episode was directed by Frank Oz and written by M. Scott Veach and Paul Guyot. The original air date of this episode was on July 31, 2011, and it had a US viewership of 3.38 million. Therefore, the statement "series number 50 has had 3.38 million viewers" is accurate and supported by the information in the table.
1612	Refuted. While Dean Devlin is listed as the director for episode 1 of season 1 ("The Long Way Down Job"), he did not direct every episode of season 1. The table lists multiple directors for each season 1 episode, and different directors are credited for other episodes. Therefore, season 1 was not directed entirely by Dean Devlin.
1613	This statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Marc Roskin directed episodes in both Season 1 and Season 2 of Leverage.
1614	The statement is not supported by the table because "The 10 Li'l Grifters Job" was actually directed by Arvin Brown, not Marc Roskin. However, the episode did air on July 3, 2011, according to the table.
1615	The statement "3.22 million viewers watched the gold job directed by Arvin Brown" is not supported by the table of Leverage episodes provided. The Gold Job is listed as being directed by Marc Roskin, not Arvin Brown. Additionally, the episode had a viewership of 2.26 million, not 3.22 million.
1616	The statement "there are three years shown when the reader's vote was na and the lifetime achievement was na" is supported by the table. As we can see from the table, in the years 1998, 2000, and 2011, there are "na" values in both the "Reader's Vote" and "Lifetime Achievement" columns, indicating that there were no winners in those categories for those years. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1617	Based on the information provided in the table, it appears that the statement "in 1998, n/a won the lifetime achievement award" is supported, as there is no entry or mention of any recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award for that year. Therefore, we can assume that the award was not given out and, as such, is considered n/a (not applicable) for that year.
1618	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows the winners of the Lifetime Achievement Award for the years 1996 to 2011. However, the table does not indicate that Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, Peter Doyle were the winners of Lifetime Achievement Award after 2005. Marele Day won the award in 2008, and Shane Maloney won it in 2009, but there is no winner listed for the award in 2011. Therefore, the statement is only partly true and can't be fully supported by the given table.
1619	The statement "in 2011, n/a was the reader's vote" is supported by the table as there is no entry for the category "Reader's vote" in the year 2011, marked as "n/a".
1620	The statement "na won the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998" is refuted by the table. As per the table, in the year 1996, Jon Cleary won the Lifetime Achievement Award, and in the year 2001, Professor Stephen Knight won the same award. Therefore, the statement is not correct, and the table shows that individuals other than "na" have won the Lifetime Achievement Award before and after the year 1998.
1621	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. While it is true that Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day have all won the Lifetime Achievement award, and there have been several years after 2005 where the Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote categories were marked as "na" (not applicable), it is not true that those five authors are the only ones to have won the Lifetime Achievement award when those categories were marked as "na."For example, in 2009, Shane Maloney won the Lifetime Achievement award, but the Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote categories were marked as "na." Therefore, the statement that only Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day are the only ones to have won the Lifetime Achievement award when those categories were marked as "na" is not accurate.
1622	Based on the table provided, the statement "na only won the reader's vote in 2011" appears to be supported. The table indicates that there were no winners for Best Teenage/Young Adult, Best Non-Fiction, or Lifetime Achievement in the Ned Kelly Awards for the year 2011. However, there isn't any information in the table about the winner of the Reader's Vote category. So, it's possible that na won the Reader's Vote in 2011, but we can't say for certain based on the information in the table.
1623	The statement "there were over three times when the reader's vote was not n/a and the lifetime achievement was also n/a" is unsupported by the table provided. There is only one instance in the table where both the "Reader's Vote" and the "Lifetime Achievement" categories have "na" (not applicable) entries, which is in row 17 (2011). Therefore, it refutes the statement that there were over three times when this occurred, as there was only one instance in the table provided.
1624	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the home media center had no os x" is supported. In row 12, under the "Operating System (OS)" column, "no" is listed for macOS (previously known as OS X).
1625	The statement "coherence has partial windows" is supported by the table. This can be seen in row 5 of the table, where it is mentioned that Coherence has a partial implementation for the Windows operating system.
1626	The statement "lgplv2 is the license for rygel" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 28 states that "rygel" has a license of "lgplv2". Therefore, the statement is true.
1627	The statement "the home media center had no OS X and Windows" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the Home Media Center is available for the Windows operating system, but there is no information provided about its compatibility with OS X.
1628	The statement "coherence is the name when windows and web interface are partial" is partially supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Coherence is a UPnP AV media server that has a MIT license and supports a partially functional web interface. However, the table does not indicate whether Coherence's support for various operating systems is partial or not. While Coherence's support for Unix-like systems is listed as "partial", there is no information provided regarding its support for Windows. Therefore, it cannot be said definitively whether Coherence's support for Windows is partial or not.
1629	The statement "GPL is the license for Rygel" is refuted by the information presented in the table. The license of Rygel is listed as "LGPLv2" in row 28 of the table.
1630	The statement "gpl is the license for jriver media center" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to row 14 of the table, the license for jriver media center is "prop" which means it is proprietary software and not licensed under the GPL.
1631	I'm sorry, but I cannot find any rows in the table that mention Bolton Wanderers. Therefore, I cannot confirm or refute the statement.
1632	The statement is supported by the table. On the date of 30 / 01 / 1991, there was a replay match between Brighton & Hove Albion (the home team) and Liverpool (the away team), with the score being 2 - 3 in favor of Liverpool. Row 3 of the table shows this information.
1633	The statement "the score was 2 - 2 when the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 2 of the table shows that in tie number 1, Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion played to a 2-2 draw on January 26th, 1991, when Brighton & Hove Albion was the away team.
1634	According to the table, the statement is supported. The score of the match between Shrewsbury Town and Wimbledon was indeed 1 - 0, as shown in row 9: "6| Shrewsbury Town| 1 - 0| Wimbledon| 26 / 01 / 1991".
1635	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "for the home team of Woking, the tie number was 5 and the score was 0-1" is supported. Row 8 in the table shows that Woking was the home team for tie number 5, and the score in that match was 0-1, with Everton as the away team.
1636	I apologize, but the information needed to verify the statement you provided is not included in the table. The table provides details about the teams, scores, and dates for each game played during the 1990-91 FA Cup, but it doesn't give details specifically about Wimbledon's home games or their scores. Without more information or context, it's difficult to say whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1637	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 3 of the table, Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion played at Anfield on 26/01/1991, with the match ending in a 2 - 2 draw. They had a replay match four days later at the Goldstone Ground in Brighton, which Liverpool won 2 - 3 (row 3).
1638	I apologize, but I couldn't find any mention of Bolton Wanderers in the table you provided. The table lists the tie number, home team, score, away team, and date of each match in the 1990-91 FA Cup, but there is no match where Bolton Wanderers played. Therefore, I can't say whether the statement about the score in a game involving Bolton Wanderers is supported or refuted by this table. Is there anything else I can help you with?
1639	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, "5| woking| 0 - 1| everton" is the tie number that corresponds to the match where Woking was the home team in a match against Everton, and it took place on January 27, 1991. Therefore, 5 was the tie no after the match that involved Woking rather than before it.
1640	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 in the table, on July 13th, set 3 score was 12 - 25.
1641	The statement is supported by the table, specifically in row 6 where it shows the score of 0-3 against an unknown opponent, with Set 3 score of 18-25, and the Total score of 53-75.
1642	According to the table, the set 2 score of 16-25 was played on July 14th, not July 15th. Therefore, the statement "the set 2 of 16 - 25 was on 15 jul" is refuted by the information in the table.
1643	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 4, the score is given as 3-0, and the total points for each team are listed as 75-34. In the set scores column, the third set is listed as "25-11", which contradicts the statement. However, the table lists the set scores in a different order than the statement, with the third set score listed as "25-13" in row 4. Therefore, the statement that "set 3 was 25 - 13 when the total was 75 - 34" is supported by the information in the table.
1644	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "at punt road oval, Richmond was Melbourne's home team opponent" is supported. In row 5 of the table, it shows that Richmond was the home team, and Melbourne was the away team. The match was played at Punt Road Oval on August 21, 1943, and the final score was Richmond - 15.19 (109) and Melbourne - 12.13 (85). Therefore, we can conclude that Richmond played against Melbourne as the home team opponent at Punt Road Oval during the 1943 VFL season.
1645	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that Richmond played Melbourne at Punt Road Oval on August 21, 1943, with Richmond being the home team and Melbourne being the away team. Therefore, we can conclude that Melbourne was indeed Richmond's away team opponent for that match at Punt Road Oval during the 1943 VFL season.
1646	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Richmond was the home team, and Melbourne was the away team. Additionally, the table shows that Richmond scored 15.19 (109) while Melbourne scored 12.13 (85), so the scores in the statement do not match the scores in the table.
1647	The statement is refuted by the information provided in the table. According to the table, North Melbourne was not playing at Glenferrie Oval on August 21, 1943. Instead, they played against Carlton as the away team at Princes Park. The game at Glenferrie Oval was played between Hawthorn and South Melbourne, as shown in row 2 of the table.
1648	The statement is supported by the information provided in the table. Row 5 of the table shows that the Philadelphia Barrage played against the Long Island Lizards on June 18, 2005. The Barrage were the away team in this game, which is consistent with the statement. The result of this game was a win for the Barrage with a score of 11-10, which is also consistent with the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1649	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 8 of the table, the Philadelphia Barrage played against the Rochester Rattlers at Bishop Kearney Field, and they won that match with a score of 26 - 15.
1650	The statement "Cannons is the opponent on July 14 at Bishop Kearney Field" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the opponent on July 14 was the Rochester Rattlers, not the Cannons.
1651	The statement is refuted by the table. The opponents on July 28 are the Lizards, not the Bayhawks. The game is a home game at Villanova Stadium, not at Nickerson Field.
1652	The statement "when the opponent was Pride, it was an away game at villanova stadium" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the game against Pride occurred on June 18 and was played away at Alumni Stadium (Kean University), not at Villanova stadium, which is listed as the home field for the Philadelphia Barrage.
1653	The statement "Stuart Potts was the man of the match during the league / cup competition on the 22nd" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to row 9 of the table, the Guildford Flames played against Wightlink Raiders on the 22nd during the league / cup competition, and Stuart Potts was named the man of the match.
1654	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9 of the table, on the 22nd of September, the Guildford Flames played against Wightlink Raiders in an away match, and the result was a "lost 5 - 4". Therefore, the statement is correct.
1655	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9 of the table, the opponents on the 22nd were indeed the Wightlink Raiders, and the game was played away. The Flames lost the game 5-4, and the attendance was 509. Stuart Potts from the Flames was named man of the match for that game.
1656	The statement that Neil Liddiard was named the man of the match in the 4 - 2 win against the Swindon Wildcats is supported by the information in the table. Based on the table, on the 9th of September 2008, the Guildford Flames played against the Swindon Wildcats and won the match 4-2 at home. The attendance for the match was 1568, and the competition was a league/cup game. The man of the match for that game was indeed Neil Liddiard, as stated in the statement.
1657	The information in the table supports the statement that the game played against the Slough Jets on the 2nd was attended by 320 fans. We can see in row 3 that the match against Slough Jets was played away, and the attendance was indeed 320. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data presented in the table.
1658	The statement "Stuart Potts wasn't the man of the match in the league/cup" is refuted by the information presented in the table. Stuart Potts was the man of the match in the game against Wightlink Raiders on the 22nd of September 2008, which was listed in the table as a league/cup game. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the data provided in the table.
1659	I'm sorry, but I can't verify that statement with the table you provided. The table has information for several matches played by the Guildford Flames during the 2008-09 season, but none of them occurred with the specific details you are mentioning. Nevertheless, if you provide me with further information or clarify your statement, I will do my best to help you.
1660	The statement "the Wightlink Raiders were the opponent at the home game" is incorrect. The table shows that the Guildford Flames played against the Milton Keynes Lightning at home on the 16th of November 2008 and not the Wightlink Raiders. The game against the Wightlink Raiders was an away game played on the 22nd of November 2008. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1661	The statement "the league / cup competition, played against the Swindon Wildcats, was lost 4 - 2 with Neil Liddiard named as man of the match" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 5 of the table, the game against the Swindon Wildcats was played on October 9th at home, and the Guildford Flames won the game 4-2. The attendance was 1568, and the competition was listed as league/cup. Neil Liddiard was named the man of the match for this game, as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is both accurate and supported by the information in the table.
1662	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. The man of the match for the game against Slough Jets on 2nd in the 2008-09 Guildford Flames season was Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital. Lukas Smital was the man of the match in the game against the Slough Jets on 1st.
1663	The statement "episode s07e04 was originally aired on October 4th, 2008" is supported by the information provided in row 5 of the table, which shows that the episode titled "The Engagement Ring" was directed by Roy Burdine, written by Robert David, and originally aired on October 4th, 2008 as the fourth episode of the seventh season (s07e04) of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV Series).
1664	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, row 4 contains the following information: "146, 3, something wicked, roy burdine, michael ryan, september 27, 2008, s07e04". Therefore, "Something Wicked" is the title of the third episode of Season 7. However, we can see that in row 5, the episode titled "The Engagement Ring" is listed as the fourth episode of Season 7, which confirms that the statement is true.
1665	Based on the information in the table provided, the statement "roy burdine directed episode s07e04" is supported. The table shows that episode "s07e04" titled "The Engagement Ring" was directed by Roy Burdine.
1666	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the episode with the production code S07E04, titled "The Engagement Ring," was originally aired on October 4, 2008, not February 28, 2009.
1667	I have checked the table, and I can confirm that the statement "episode 11 is season 7 was titled the engagement ring" is false. According to the table, episode 4 of season 7 is titled "The Engagement Ring," not episode 11.
1668	The statement is supported by the table. In row 4, it shows that Oleksandr Vorobiov from Ukraine had an "a score" of 7.2 and a "b score" of 9.05, giving him a total score of 16.25, confirming the statement.
1669	The statement in question is supported by the table. As we can see from the table:- Andrea Coppolino (ITA), who is in the 6th position, has an A score of 6.8, which satisfies the first condition of the statement.- Chen Yibing (CHN) has the highest B score in the table, which is 9.225, and is therefore greater than the threshold specified in the statement.- The total scores of the gymnasts in positions 1-5 are all greater than 15.975.- Andrea Coppolino (ITA) has a total score of 15.975, which satisfies the second condition of the statement.Therefore, we can see that the statement is supported by the table.
1670	The statement "the proteus mirabilis has a negative voges - proskauer reading" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the fourth row of the table, which lists the results for Salmonella spp, the voges-proskauer test is negative, and, in the seventh row, Proteus mirabilis has a positive result for the voges-proskauer test. Therefore, it can be concluded that Proteus mirabilis has a positive voges-proskauer reading, not a negative one.
1671	Based on the table provided, the statement "the species that test positive for indol also test positive on the methyl red reading" is supported. If we look at the table, we can see that Proteus vulgaris and Escherichia coli both test positive for indole and methyl red. Conversely, Klebsiella spp, Shigella spp, and Enterobacter aerogenes all test negative for both indole and methyl red. Therefore, based on the information in the table, species that test positive for indole also test positive on the methyl red reading, and the statement is supported.
1672	According to the table, the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis is indeed positive, in row 7 of the table. Therefore, the statement is **supported** by the information presented in the table.
1673	The statement "the Proteus mirabilis has a positive Voges-Proskauer reading" is supported by the given table. In row 7, under the Voges-Proskauer column, the Proteus mirabilis has a "positive" reading, confirming that this statement is correct.
1674	Based on the table provided, the statement "the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis is negative" is refuted. According to the table, the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis is positive.
1675	Supported. According to the table, Week 12 was played on December 2, 2001, and the Cincinnati Bengals played against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and lost with a score of 16-13.
1676	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "on week 12 the attendance was 64217" is supported. According to row 6 of the table, which corresponds to week 12, the game was played against the Cleveland Browns, and the attendance was 64217. So, the statement is accurate.
1677	Based on the information given in the table, the statement is correct. In row 11 of the table, we can see that the Bengals played against the Cleveland Browns on Week 11 and lost with a score of 18-0. However, in row 14 of the table, we can see that the Bengals played against the New York Jets on Week 14 and lost with a score of 15-14. Therefore, the opponent on Week 14 was not the Cleveland Browns, but the New York Jets. So, as per the information in the table, the statement "the opponent is at cleveland browns on week 14" is refuted.
1678	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the game against Georgetown on November 17, Lavoy Allen was the high scorer for Temple Owls with 12 points.
1679	The statement is supported by the table. We can see in row 6 that the Temple Owls beat Virginia Tech with a final score of 61 - 50 on November 27, 2009.
1680	Based on the information in the table, the statement "only one game was played on November 27" is supported. The table only lists one game played on November 27th, and the location and attendance information is given for that one game, which was between Temple University and Virginia Tech. Therefore, it can be concluded that only one game was played on November 27th by the 2009-10 Temple Owls men's basketball team.
1681	I apologize for any confusion, but the statement you provided does not match the table you provided. The table only goes up to the game against Virginia Tech, and the final score mentioned in the statement does not match any of the scores listed in the table. However, based on the information in the table, I can tell you that the Temple Owls did beat Ball State with a final score of 66-46 in their fourth game of the season. Therefore, if the statement had been "the final score was 66 - 46 when the Temple Owls beat Ball State", then it would be supported by the information in the table.
1682	According to the table, the statement is supported. There is only one game listed for November 27th, which is Temple Owls vs. Virginia Tech with a final score of 61-50. Therefore, the statement "only 2 games were played on November 27th" is correct as per the table.
1683	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Ukraine has a total score of 2 with 0 gold and 1 silver. The information in row 10 shows that Ukraine won 0 gold, 1 silver, and 1 bronze medal, with a total score of 2 in the 2006-07 ISU Junior Grand Prix.
1684	The statement "Ukraine has the most gold medals" is refuted by the information in the table about the 2006-07 ISU Junior Grand Prix. According to the table, the United States has the most gold medals with 24, followed by Russia with 5 gold medals. Ukraine is tied for seventh place with two other countries (France and Spain) with zero gold medals. Therefore, the statement "Ukraine has the most gold medals" is not supported by the table.
1685	The statement "highest total score for Ukraine is 2 while the highest total score of Estonia is 8" is supported by the table. As we can see, the highest total score for Ukraine is two, and it is tied for the seventh-highest total score with France. On the other hand, Estonia's highest total score is 8, which puts them in fifth place in the overall standings. Therefore, the table confirms that the statement is accurate.
1686	The statement is supported by the information in row 30 of the table, which shows that Joachim Hansen fought and defeated Rumina Sato via TKO (punches) at the Shooto 2003 event on March 18th in Tokyo, Japan.
1687	The statement is supported by the table. Joachim Hansen fought against Shinya Aoki at Dream 11, and the match ended at 4:56 in the second round via submission by armbar from Shinya Aoki.
1688	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 18 of the table states that Joachim Hansen won via KO (knee) against Luiz Azeredo at Pride Bushido 10.
1689	The statement that "shooto 2003: 3 / 18 was the event in Turku, Finland and had an opponent of Rumina Sato" is not supported by the table. The table does not show any record of Joachim Hansen fighting Rumina Sato at Shooto 2003: 3 / 18. The table only shows one fight in which Joachim Hansen fought Rumina Sato, which was at Shooto 2003: 3 / 18 where Joachim Hansen won by tko (punches) in the first round, but the location of the event is not mentioned in the table.
1690	Unfortunately, I cannot support or refute the statement as there is no mention of "round 3" in the provided table. The table only includes information about the event, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location.
1691	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Joachim Hansen did fight at Dream 11, but the opponent listed was Shinya Aoki, not Caol Uno. Additionally, the table does not provide the exact time of the fight, so it is unclear whether the fight took place at 5:00 or not.
1692	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Joachim Hansen won by KO (knee) in Pride Bushido 10, on the 1st round and at 7:09 of the match. Therefore, the statement "pride bushido 10 never had ko (knee) method" is false.
1693	The statement "jessica shepley received a winner's share of 14000 when she won the Beaver Meadow Golf Course tournament" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 4 of the table, Jessica Shepley from Canada won the Beaver Meadow Golf Course tournament in 2011, and the table shows that she received a winner's share of $14,000. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1694	The statement "in 2012, the champion was from the United States" is supported by the information in the table. Jenny Gleason won the championship in 2012 with a score of 211 (5), and her country of origin is listed as the United States in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1695	Based on the information in the table, the statement "after 2012 the winner's share was never less than 15000" is supported by the data. In 2012, the winner's share was 15000, and in every year after that (2013-2020), the winner's share was equal to or greater than 15000. Therefore, the statement is true according to the given data in the table.
1696	The statement is not supported by the table. Although Jenny Shin won the tournament in 2010, her winner's share at that time was $15,400, not $14,000.
1697	This statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table since the table only provides information from 2004 to 2013, and the statement refers to purses after 2012. Additionally, the table only provides information about purses for the Northeast Delta Dental International tournament, and does not provide information about other tournaments. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if this statement is true or false based on the information presented in the table.
1698	The statement "on August 15th, 2012, the team booked a win in a friendly competition match" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, on August 15th, 2012, in Baku, Azerbaijan, Branimir Subasic's team won by 3-0 in a friendly match. Hence, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1699	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the match on August 15, 2012, resulted in a win with a score of 3-0, and it was played at a venue in Baku, Azerbaijan. Therefore, the information in the table confirms that the competition on August 15th, 2012, which resulted in a win, was indeed played at a Baku, Azerbaijan venue.
1700	The statement "on August 15th, 2012, the game had a score of 3-0 and resulted in a win" is supported by the table. The table shows that on August 15th, 2012, in a match held in Baku, Azerbaijan, Branimir Subašić's team won with a score of 3-0 in a friendly game.
1701	The statement "the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying had a result of lost" is supported by the information in the table. As per row 3 of the table, Branimir Subašić played a match on June 2, 2007, in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying competition. The score in that match was 1-3, with Branimir Subašić on the losing team. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1702	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, on June 2, 2007, Branimir Subašić and his team played against Azerbaijan in Baku, in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match, which they lost 1-3. Therefore, Branimir Subašić did not win any competition on June 2, 2007, and the competition he participated in is not a friendly, but a qualifying match for the UEFA Euro 2008.
1703	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that the friendly match at the venue Shymkent, Kazakhstan took place on March 7, 2007, not on June 2, 2007. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1704	The statement is incorrect. The table shows that the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match listed in the table had a score of 1-3, but it was held in Baku, Azerbaijan and not in Andorra la Vella, Andorra. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1705	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, on June 2, 2007, Branimir Subašić played in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying competition held in Baku, Azerbaijan, which resulted in a 1-3 loss. However, the date mentioned in the statement (August 22, 2007) is not related to the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying competition but instead is related to a friendly match against Tajikistan, which Azerbaijan won 2-3.
1706	I'm sorry but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. From the table, we know that on Episode 1, aired on October 15, 2007, Celia Norowzian and Ian Forshew pitched their company Beach Break Live and requested £50,000. Peter Jones is the investing Dragon who invested in Beach Break Live.However, there is no mention of Cone Timentrate Design in this table. Likewise, there is no mention of the investment amount of £35,000. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the statement is true or false based on the information provided in the table.
1707	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In Row 7, it can be seen that Max McMurdo, the entrepreneur behind the company Reestore, requested 50000 from Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis. Hence, the statement is true.
1708	The statement "Gaming Alerts asked for 200000" is supported by the table. In row 5, it is mentioned that Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens from Gaming Alerts asked for £200,000, and Theo Paphitis decided to invest in their project.
1709	The statement is refuted by the information in the table. In episode 7, the highest amount of money requested was 100,000 by Sammy French for Fit Fur Life, and by Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker for JPM Eco Logistics.
1710	The statement "reestore requested 70000 from Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, in episode 4 of Dragons' Den (UK), Max McMurdo pitched his company Reestore and requested £50,000. He ended up getting investment from Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. There was no mention of Reestore requesting £70,000.
1711	The statement "Gaming alerts asked for the least amount of money" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 5, Gaming alerts requested £200,000, which was higher than all other requests in the table. Therefore, it asked for the highest amount of money, and the statement is refuted.
1712	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Huracán had a score of 40 in the 1991-92 season and then improved slightly to a score of 43 in the 1993-94 season. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1713	Based on the table, the statement is accurate. Huracán had a score of 38 points in the 1992-93 season and 43 points in the 1993-94 season.
1714	I apologize, but I'm not able to confirm or refute the statement based solely on the table provided. The table only presents data for the 1992 - 93 Argentine Primera División season, and it doesn't include any information about the 1991 - 92 or 1993 - 94 seasons having a "42" or "43". Please provide more context or information related to the statement in question, and I'll do my best to help you determine whether it's supported or refuted by the available data.
1715	I'm sorry, but I'm a language model AI and I am not able to directly understand the statement you've provided. Could you please rephrase or clarify the statement? Thank you.
1716	Refuted. None of the bridges listed in the table is located in Stanley, let alone a bridge of the concrete deck girder style.
1717	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the bridge named "Colton's Crossing Bridge" located in Lisbon, Ransom County, is a "Pratt through truss" type bridge.
1718	The statement is supported by the table as the Westgaard Bridge is listed as a "Pratt pony through truss" bridge in the table.
1719	According to the table, the Romness Bridge in Cooperstown, North Dakota, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and it is a Pratt through truss type bridge. Therefore, the statement "Cooperstown has a Pratt through truss type bridge" is supported by the information in the table.
1720	The statement that "Nesheim Bridge is in Mcville" is supported by the table. Row 16 of the table lists "Nesheim Bridge" as being located in "Mcville" under the "location" and "county" columns.
1721	Based on the information in the table, the statement that "Cooperstown is famous for the Blanchard Bridge" is refuted. While Cooperstown is listed as the location for the Romness Bridge on the National Register of Historic Places in North Dakota, the Blanchard Bridge was located in Blanchard, which is listed in the table as a separate location. Additionally, the Blanchard Bridge was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 2009, according to the table.
1722	I apologize, but the table provided does not contain any information related to the current construction status or structural issues of the Goose River Bridge in Mcville, North Dakota. Therefore, I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1723	Sorry, that statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table as there is no bridge named "Grace City Bridge" or "Stanley" in the table.
1724	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, "Colton's Crossing Bridge" is listed on the national register of historic places, and it is located in Lisbon (which is in Ransom county), but it is a "Pratt through truss" type bridge located in Adams county. Thus, the statement "Colton's Crossing Bridge is a Pratt through truss in Adams county" is accurate based on the information presented in the table.
1725	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. The Westgaard Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a "Pratt Pony Through Truss" bridge, and is located in Voltaire, which is in McHenry County, North Dakota. So, while the bridge is not in Traill County as mentioned in the statement, it is a Pratt Pony Through Truss bridge, as stated.
1726	The table confirms the statement that the 4.2.1 Jelly Bean Android version was released on November 27, 2012, and is the latest stable release, as shown in the first row of the table.
1727	The statement "the Android browser for Android has a Theora version of 2.3 and an H264 version of 3.0" can be supported by the table.

Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1728	The statement "Google Chrome supports both VP8 (WebM) 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) 29.0" is supported by the table. In row 4, under "Google Chrome," we can see that it supports both VP8 (WebM) 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) 29.0.
1729	Yes, the statement "konqueror supports only vp8 (webm) 4.4, but not vp9 (webm)" is supported by the table. In row 8, under the "vp8 (webm)" column, it shows that Konqueror supports version 4.4. However, under the "vp9 (webm)" column, it says "no", meaning that Konqueror does not support VP9 webm.
1730	The statement you provided is refuted by the information in the table. In the table, when theora is 2.3 and the h264 is 3.0, the vp8 (webm) version is actually 2.3, not r47759. Therefore, the information presented in the table refutes the statement you provided.
1731	The statement "when vp8 (webm) is 6.0, and the vp9 (webm) is 29.0, the operating system is Windows" is only partially supported by the table. Based on the table, we know that the value for vp8 (webm) is 6.0 in the Google Chrome browser, which has a latest stable release version of 30.0.1599.101 and is supported on various operating systems including Windows. However, the table does not include information on the version number for vp9 (webm) in the Google Chrome browser, so it cannot confirm or refute the statement in that regard.Additionally, the table doesn't provide any information on the vp8 (webm) and vp9 (webm) versions in other browsers or operating systems, so it cannot speak to those specific conditions.Overall, the statement is partially supported by the table, but it cannot be fully confirmed or refuted without additional information.
1732	The statement is supported by the table. In row 2, it shows that the latest stable release for Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean (November 27, 2012) has a support of h264 at version 3.0, but it does not support vp9 (webm).
1733	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, on November 28, 2004, the Cleveland Browns played against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium, and the attendance for that game was 65,677 people.
1734	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, the game on October 17, 2004, had an attendance of 73263, which matches the given statement.
1735	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Week 6 of the 2004 NFL season was played on October 17, 2004. This is the same date as the game listed in Row 6 of the table, which shows that the Cleveland Browns played against the Cincinnati Bengals and won with a score of 34-17 at the Cleveland Browns Stadium. Therefore, the statement is correct and is supported by the information presented in the table.
1736	The statement "the Browns record after they played the game at the Paul Brown Stadium was 3-8" is supported by the table. As per the table, the Browns played at Paul Brown Stadium in Week 12 against the Cincinnati Bengals, and their record after that game was 3-8.
1737	I'm sorry, but the statement "Paul Brown Stadium had 65,677 in attendance on December 19, 2004" cannot be supported or refuted by the table you provided because the table does not list any game played at Paul Brown Stadium on that date. The table only indicates that on November 28, 2004, the Browns played against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium and had a record attendance of 65,677. However, it should be noted that the attendance figure for that game is not relevant to the statement you provided.
1738	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. The game played on October 17, 2004, was against the Cincinnati Bengals, not the San Diego Chargers, and had 73,263 in attendance, as indicated in row 6 of the table. The game against the San Diego Chargers was played on December 19, 2004, and had a different attendance of 72,489, as indicated in row 15.
1739	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. The game played on October 17, 2004, was not at M&T Bank Stadium, but rather at Cleveland Browns Stadium. Additionally, it was not week 6 of the season, but rather week 7. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1740	I'm sorry, but the statement is refuted by the table. None of the information provided in the rows of the table matches the given statement. There is no row in the table that corresponds to a friendly competition that took place on 26 May 1999 in Lugo, Emilia-Romagna. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information in the table.
1741	I'm sorry to inform you that the statement is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that the match on 26 May 1999 was a friendly match with the venue listed as "Lugo" in Emilia-Romagna, but the result of the match was "1-4" and not "2-4" as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1742	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the season finale for season 4 of CSI aired on May 21, 2008.
1743	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The first row of the table shows that the season premiere of the first season of CSI aired on September 22, 2004, and had a rank of 21. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
1744	Yes, the statement is supported by the information in the table. The row for season 4 shows that the season premiered on September 26, 2007, during the 2007-2008 TV season.
1745	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the only season finale that occurred on May 26th in any year for the CSI franchise was during the 2009-2010 season for season 6. Therefore, there was only one season finale on May 26, 2010.
1746	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that there is only one season with a season premiere date of September 23, 2009, which is Season 6. However, the statement about the number of episodes is incorrect as Season 6 only has 23 episodes. Therefore, there are not more than 23 episodes where the season premiere is September 23, 2009.
1747	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, the season finale for the 2007-2008 season of CSI took place on May 21, 2008, not on September 26, 2007.
1748	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the production number 23, episode number 209, original airdate March 31, 2008, and the episode title is "New York: Secret Societies," hosted by Don Wildman.
1749	The statement "episode number 202 aired on February 4, 2008" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, row 3 shows that episode 202 aired on February 4, 2008, and the episode title was "Vietnam," with Don Wildman serving as the host.
1750	The statement is incorrect. The title of the episode that aired in January 28, 2008, is "Underground Apocalypse." The table shows that Episode 201, hosted by Don Wildman, aired on that date, and its title is "Underground Apocalypse." Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1751	The statement is refuted by the table. The episode number 213 aired on May 5, 2008, while the date given in the statement (January 28, 2008) corresponds to the airdate of episode number 201. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1752	The statement is supported by the table. The Kings Dominion park has a drop tower called "gyro drop" with a tower height of 305 feet and a drop height of 272 feet, and the table indicates that it was opened on March 22, 2003.
1753	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, under the column "model", "giant drop" is listed for three parks: Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, and California's Great America. The drop height of the giant drop attraction at Canada's Wonderland is 200 feet, and the speed is listed as 62 mph in the table. This matches the statement that the speed of the giant drop attraction with a drop height of 200 feet is 62 mph. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1754	The statement, "Kings Island's attraction opened in 1999," is supported by the table. In row 6, it states that Kings Island's drop tower, called gyro drop, opened in 1999.
1755	The statement "the speed of the giant drop 200 feet is 56 mph" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the model of the ride at Carowinds and California's Great America is the Giant Drop, with a tower height of 174 feet and 224 feet, respectively. The drop height for both rides is listed as 100 feet and 207 feet, respectively, which matches the 200-foot drop mentioned in the statement. The speed for both rides is listed as 56 mph, which confirms the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1756	The statement "Kings Island opened before 1999" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Kings Island's drop tower named Gyro Drop opened in 1999. Therefore, the statement that Kings Island opened before 1999 is not supported by the information in the table.
1757	Based on the information in the table, we see that the only drop height that matches this measurement is found in the row for Kings Dominion, and it shows that the Gyro Drop ride has a drop height of 272 feet, which opened on March 22, 2003. Therefore, the statement that "the drop height of 272 feet was opened before March 22, 2003" is refuted by the information in the table.
1758	The statement "the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 has a frequency of 2 GHz" is supported by the table. According to row 7 of the table, the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 has a frequency of 2 GHz, which is listed under the "frequency" column.
1759	The statement "part number lf80537 gf0411 m has a frequency of 2 GHz" is supported by the table. According to the table, lf80537 gf0411 m is associated with the Pentium Dual-core T3200 microprocessor, which has a clock speed of 2 GHz (frequency column in the table). Therefore, the statement is true.
1760	The statement "the pentium dual - core t3200 has a lf80537 gf0411 m part number and a fsb of 667 mt / s" is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 has a part number of LF80537GF0411M and a FSB of 667 MT/s (row 7).
1761	Supported. Looking at the table, the processor with the part number of lf80537 ge0251 mn is the Pentium Dual-Core T2330, which has a listed FSB (Front Side Bus) speed of 533 mt/s in the second row. Therefore, the statement "the processor with a part number of lf80537 ge0251 mn has a fsb of 533 mt / s" is supported by the information in the table.
1762	Based on the information in the table, the statement that "the Pentium Dual-Core T2410 has a P socket" is supported. In Row 6 of the table, under the "Socket" column, it states "Socket P", which indicates that the Pentium Dual-Core T2410 uses a P socket.
1763	The statement that the "sla4h (m0)" model has a release date of Q2 2008 is supported by the information presented in the table. According to Row 5 of the table, the "Pentium Dual-Core T2390" has an "SSPEC Number" of "SLA4H (M0)" and a "Release Date" of "Q2 2008".
1764	The statement you provided is not supported by the information given in the table because it showed Pentium Dual-Core T3200 with release date Q4 2008 not Q2 2008, and the sspec number listed is SLAVG (M0), not SLA4H (M0). However, the frequency of Pentium Dual-Core T3200 given in the table is correct, which is 2 GHz.
1765	The statement is not supported by the table as the part number "lf80537 gf0411 m" listed in the table has an FSB of 667 MT/s and not 533 MT/s. Additionally, the corresponding row in the table lists the model number as "pentium dual - core t3200" and not "t2390" which is the model number with 533 MT/s FSB. Lastly, the sspec number for part number lf80537 gf0411 m is listed as "slavg (m0)" and not "sla4h (m0)" which is the sspec number mentioned in the statement.
1766	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The part number LF80537GF0411M is associated with the Pentium Dual-Core T3200, which has an FSB of 667 MT/s, as shown in row 7 of the table. However, the release price for this processor was not $90, as stated in the statement, but rather it is listed as "OEM" in the table, which indicates that it was sold as part of a larger system, rather than as an individual retail product. Therefore, we cannot state what the actual release price was for this processor.
1767	I apologize for the previous response as it was incorrect. Thank you for providing the statement for me to check against the table. However, the statement you provided is not supported by the table. The sSpec number that corresponds to part number "lf80537 ge0251 mn" is "sla4k (m0)" and not "sla4 g (m0)". The model number associated with the sSpec number "sla4k (m0)" is "Pentium Dual-Core T2330" and according to the table, it has "FSB 533 MT/s".Therefore, the statement "part number lf80537 ge0251 mn of sspec number sla4 g (m0) has fsb 533 mt / s" is refuted by the table.
1768	I apologize, but the statement you provided is incorrect. There is no entry in the table for Pentium Dual-Core T2410 with sspec number sla4j (m0). However, according to the table, the Pentium Dual-Core T2410 has the sspec number sla4g (m0), a frequency of 2 GHz, 1 MB of L2 cache, an FSB of 533 MT/s, a mult of 15, a voltage range of 1.075 - 1.175v, a TDP of 35 W, and a socket type of P. Its release date is listed as Q3 2008, and its part number is lf80537 ge0411 m. Therefore, I must refute the statement "Pentium Dual-Core T2410 with sspec number sla4j (m0) has socket p and release date q2 2008" based on the information presented in the table.
1769	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the model with sspec number sla4h (m0) has a release date of q2 2008, but its part number is listed as lf80537 ge0361 m, not lf80537 ge0301 m.
1770	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "Princes Park is home to the Carlton team" is supported. In row 4 of the table, the home team is listed as Carlton, and the venue for the game is given as Princes Park, which indicates that Princes Park is indeed the home ground of the Carlton team. Therefore, the statement is consistent with the information provided in the table.
1771	The statement "sonya tayeh was the jazz choreographer" is supported by the table. The table shows that Sonya Tayeh was the choreographer for Courtney Galiano and Mark Kanemura's jazz routine performed to the song "The Garden" by Mirah. This information is shown in row 3 of the table.
1772	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, "Katee Shean Joshua Allen" performed the "Paso Doble" dance choreographed by "Jason Gilkison" to the music "Filet from Le Rêve" and their result was "safe". Therefore, the safe result was choreographed by Jason Gilkison to Filet from Le Rêve.
1773	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 4 of the table, the couple Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced the contemporary piece "All By Myself" choreographed by Tyce Diorio.
1774	I'm sorry, but that statement is not supported by the table. Katee Shean and Joshua Allen did dance to "Filet" from "Le Rêve", as indicated in row 5 of the table, but the choreographer was Jason Gilkison, not Tyce Diorio. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1775	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is supported. Row 4 shows that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced to "All By Myself" by Celine Dion in the contemporary style, and row 5 shows that they danced to the song again, but in the Paso Doble style, with the choreography by Jason Gilkison, and they were safe.
1776	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performed a contemporary dance to "All By Myself" by Celine Dion choreographed by Tyce Diorio and were safe. However, they did not perform a jazz dance in this particular episode.
1777	The statement "the choreographer (s) for the style jazz were Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh" is partially supported by the table. The table shows that in "So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. Season 4)", Courtney Galiano and Mark Kanemura performed a jazz routine choreographed by Sonya Tayeh. However, there is no mention of Tyce Diorio choreographing a jazz performance in this season. Therefore, while Sonya Tayeh did choreograph a jazz routine, Tyce Diorio's involvement with jazz choreography in season 4 is not shown in the table.
1778	The statement "round 9 involved the name Glenn Capriola" is supported by the information in the table. Glenn Capriola is listed in row 7, which indicates that he was selected in the 9th round of the draft (24th pick in the round, 247th overall). Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1779	The statement is supported by the information provided in the table. According to the table, Glenn Capriola was selected with the 24th pick in the 9th round, as shown in Row 7, where the "round" column indicates "9," the "pick" column indicates "24," the "overall" column indicates "247," and the "name" column indicates "Glenn Capriola," who played as a running back and attended Boston College.
1780	The statement is not supported by the table. Glenn Capriola was selected in round 9 with the 247th overall pick.
1781	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Glenn Capriola is listed as the pick for the Indianapolis Colts in round 9, with an overall pick of 247.
1782	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Looking at the table, we see that Calvin O'Neal is listed in row 4 and was picked in the 6th round with the 163rd overall pick. Therefore, there is no mention of Calvin O'Neal being picked in a round larger than 6, and the total overall pick for him is 163, which is not larger than 6 rounds. Hence, the statement is true based on the presented data.
1783	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in round 9 of the draft, the Indianapolis Colts selected Glen Capriola, who played college football at Boston College.
1784	The statement "running back Calvin O'Neal was drafted with pick 24 of round 6" is supported by the information in the table. Calvin O'Neal's information is listed in row 4, which shows that he was drafted with pick number 24 in the 6th round. Therefore, the statement is accurate and supported by the table.
1785	According to the table, the statement is false. The 216 locomotive has a lbsc name of Granville, which has a lower 1st lbsc number (1883) than the 217 locomotive (1883). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1786	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Brad Gumm participated in a 1 round match against Hank Weis, a 2 round match against Don Ortega in Mexico, a 2 round match against Heath Sims in Oregon, a 1 round match against Carlos Condit in Colorado, a no contest match against Doug Evans in Colorado, a 2 round match against Antoine Skinner in Illinois, a 2 round match against Michael Buell in Mexico, a 3 round match against Eric Davila in Colorado, a 3 round match against Brad Blackburn in Alberta, Canada, a 3 round match against Joe Stevenson in California, a 3 round match against Joe Stevenson in Colorado, a 2 round match against Brian Dunn in South Dakota, a 3 round match against Jeff Lindsay in Colorado, a 1 round match against Clint Rather in Colorado, a draw against CJ Fernandes in Louisiana, a loss against Shonie Carter in Louisiana, a 1 round submission against Dario Valdez in Colorado, and a 1 round submission against Jason McKeever in the United States.
1787	The statement in question cannot be supported or refuted by the table, as no match information in the table corresponds with the given details. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if Brian Dunn was the opponent of a match that took place in South Dakota with 3 rounds based solely on the information in the table.
1788	The statement is supported by the table. In row 2 of the table, under the event "Pancrase - Impressive Tour 9", Katsuya Inoue's record was 19-9-4, and he suffered a loss to Naoyuki Kotani by submission (armbar). The time of the fight was 1:44. Therefore, the statement "at the pacrase - impressive tour 9, the record was 19-9-4 with a time of 1:44" is true according to the information presented in the table.
1789	The statement is supported by the table. From the table, we can see that Katsuya Inoue fought Daisuke Hanazawa at the GCM - Dog 4 event, and won the fight by a decision (majority) in the third round. Therefore, the statement "at the GCM - Dog 4 event, Daisuke Hanazawa was the opponent" is supported by the information in the table.
1790	The statement "in Tokyo, Japan, Hikaru Sato's match ended before round 2" is supported by the information in the table. In row 27, it is indicated that Katsuya Inoue won the match against Hikaru Sato by TKO (punches) in round 1, at a time of 3:53. Therefore, the statement is correct.
1791	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that the match with a time of 1:44 took place in Tokyo, not Saitama, and the record of the fighter in that match was loss 19 - 9 - 4. However, the opponent, event, round, method, and location information are accurate.
1792	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 20 of the table, Katsuya Inoue fought Daisuke Hanazawa at GCM - DOG 4 in Chiba, Japan.
1793	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Row 27 of the table shows that Katsuya Inoue won a match against Hikaru Sato by TKO (punches) in round 1 at Pancrase - Brave 6, which took place in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, the statement that "Tokyo, Japan was the location of the match that ended after round 1 against Hikaru Sato" is true based on the information in the table.
1794	The statement "Paulo Costa is moving to Anorthosis Famagusta during the transfer window" is supported by the information in the table. Row 13 of the table shows that Paulo Costa moved to Anorthosis Famagusta in a mutual consent loan return during the winter transfer window.
1795	The statement "for the nat por, it is a mutual consent loan return, and the transfer fee is free" is supported by the table. As we can see from row 13, Paulo Costa from Portugal (nat por) had a mutual consent loan return from Anorthosis Famagusta to Apoel F.C. during the winter transfer window. The transfer fee is listed as free in the table, which confirms that the transfer was not subject to any payment.
1796	Yes, the statement "por has a free transfer fee" is supported by the table. According to the table, Paulo Costa (por) transferred to Apoel F.C. on "mutual consent loan return" during the winter transfer window in the 2008-09 season, and his transfer fee was listed as "free". Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1797	Supported. According to the table, row 11 shows that the player has the nationality "mkd" (which stands for North Macedonia), and his name is "nikolovski". Therefore, the statement "the nat mkd has the name nikolovski" is supported by the information in the table.
1798	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Paulo Costa's name is listed, but his "moving to" column shows that he returned to Anorthosis Famagusta on loan, not Trofense during the transfer window of winter. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1799	The statement "Paulo Costa of POR is retiring at the end of the season" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Paulo Costa is returning on loan to Apoel FC in the winter transfer window after a mutual consent loan with Anorthosis Famagusta. There is no mention of retirement in the table, and his loan move suggests that he is still an active player. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1800	The statement "por type is retirement" cannot be supported or refuted by the information presented in the table as there is no row or information provided in the table for a player with the nationality of "por" and a retirement under the "type" column. The table only includes information on players from Greece, Cyprus, Serbia, Brazil, and Macedonia with their respective transfer information for the 2008-09 apoel f.c. season.
1801	I'm sorry, but I cannot find any information in the table regarding the player Paphos being released by MKD. The table only includes information about players who are either moving to or leaving APOEL FC during the 2008-09 season, along with the transfer details. Please let me know if there's any other statement or information that you would like me to check against the table.
1802	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Manchester United played against Blackburn Rovers on January 7th, 2003, and the result was a 1-1 draw. The table also shows that it was the "semi-final first leg". Therefore, the statement that the round played on January 7th, 2003, was the first leg of the semi-final is supported by the table.
1803	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the final result on December 17th, 2002 was 1-0" is supported. The row for December 17th, 2002, shows that Manchester United played against Chelsea in round 5 and won by a score of 1-0.
1804	The statement "On January 7th, 2003, the attendance was 62740" is supported by the table. As per the table, on 7th January 2003, Manchester United played the semi-final first leg match against Blackburn Rovers, and the attendance for the match was recorded as 62740 in the table.
1805	The statement "the match played on 7th January recorded an attendance greater than 70000" is refuted by the table. According to the given table, the match played on 7th January was a semi-final first leg against Blackburn Rovers, and the attendance recorded was 62,740, which is less than 70,000.
1806	The statement "the semifinal first leg recorded attendance less than 50000" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the attendance for the semi-final first leg against Blackburn Rovers was 62,740, which is greater than 50,000. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1807	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the goalkeeper Miguel Zapata, who played 28 matches for Atletico Ciudad, had an average of 0.61, and there is no other goalkeeper on the table who played for Atletico Ciudad or had an average below 0.61. This implies that Miguel Zapata's average was never below 0.61 for all the 28 matches he played for Atletico Ciudad during the 2008-09 Segunda División B.
1808	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. The table provides information on the performance of several goalkeepers in the 2008-09 Segunda División B, and it does not include any data related to goals scored by goalkeepers. Additionally, the table only provides information on the number of goals conceded by the goalkeepers, not the number of goals scored. Therefore, there is no way to support or refute the statement based on the information presented in the table.
1809	The statement is supported by the table. The highest average for Atletico Ciudad, located in row 2, was indeed 0.61, which was accomplished by their goalkeeper, Miguel Zapata. Therefore, the statement that the highest average for Atletico Ciudad was 0.61 is supported by the information presented in the table.
1810	The statement is supported by the table. As per the data in the table, Miguel Zapata had 17 goals which is the fewest number of goals among all the goalkeepers listed in the table.
1811	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Álvaro Campos is the goalkeeper for Real Murcia B, and their average of goals per match is 0.86, which is lower than the highest-average team (Lorca Deportiva, with 0.85). Therefore, the team that Álvaro Campos plays for did not have any matches with an average higher than 0.61.
1812	The statement is actually incorrect. According to the table, Miguel Zapata is a goalkeeper, but he only scored 17 goals in 28 matches with an average of 0.61, while Rubén Martínez scored 24 goals in 32 matches with an average of 0.75. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1813	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, the goalkeeper for Atlético Ciudad, Miguel Zapata, played 28 matches in the season with an average of 0.61 goals per match, which is less than 0.61. Therefore, the statement is true.
1814	The statement "Miguel Zapata had exactly 24 goals under his name" is refuted by the table. From the given table, we can see that Miguel Zapata only played as a goalkeeper and did not score any goals during the season. Instead, we can see that Rubén Martínez had the highest number of goals (24) for his team, Cartagena.
1815	Yes, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. As we can see, all the players selected in rounds higher than 4, i.e., Rounds 1, 2, and 3, were from either Canada or the United States. Thomas Hickey, Oscar Moller, Wayne Simmonds, and Bryan Cameron are from Canada, while Alec Martinez is from the United States. Therefore, the table shows that players from only two nationalities, Canada and the United States, were selected in rounds higher than 4 during the 2007-08 Los Angeles Kings season.
1816	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that the players in rounds 1, 2, and 3 are from Canada and the United States. Specifically, Thomas Hickey, the player in round 1, is from Canada, and Oscar Moller, Wayne Simmonds, and Bryan Cameron, who are in rounds 2 and 3, are also from Canada. Additionally, Alec Martinez, who is in round 4, is from the United States, but rounds 1-3 do not have any players from other nationalities. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1817	The statement that "Sergio Luis Henao was given the general classification award and the points classification award" is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Sergio Luis Henao won the General Classification and Points Classification in the 2010 Vuelta a Colombia. It can be seen in rows 1, 9, 10, 11, and 12, where Henao is listed as the winner of the general and points classifications.
1818	The statement "jaime vergara won in the 11th stage, with the team classification given to epm - une and the mountains classification given to oscar solis" is partially supported by the table. It is correct that Jaime Vergara won the 11th stage of the 2010 Vuelta a Colombia, as indicated in the table. However, the team classification for that stage was not given to EPM-UNE, but rather to Ind Ant-Idea-Fla-Lot de Medellin, as shown in the table. Additionally, while the table does not provide information on the team classification for the entire race, it does not mention Oscar Solis winning the mountains classification, so it is unknown whether that part of the statement is supported by the table.
1819	Sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be checked against the table as it doesn't specify which stage or overall winner you are referring to. The table only provides information about the winners of each stage, the general classification, the points classification, the mountains classification, the sprints classification, and the team classification. Without further information about which winner you are referring to, I can't determine if your statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1820	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table in row 4, game 62 on March 5th against Houston, Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon were the high rebounders of the game with seven rebounds each.
1821	The statement is supported by the table as row 7 shows that Toronto Raptors lost game 65 against Orlando with a score of 79-92 in overtime.
1822	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, on March 10, the Toronto Raptors played against the Orlando Magic and Vince Carter had 16 points, which is not the highest for that game. Alvin Williams did have 7 assists, but that's not the highest either. Therefore, the statement "on march 10, vince carter (43) had high points and alvin williams (9) had high assists" is refuted by the information in the table.
1823	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the Raptors' game number 72 was played on March 28 against the Atlanta Hawks with a score of W 85-83 (OT). The game against Cleveland is recorded as game number 69, which the Raptors won with a score of W 94-80 (OT).
1824	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 11, on February 24, NY Rangers visited Vancouver and the score was 4-5 in favor of Vancouver.
1825	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, the visitor in Vancouver on February 24 was the New York Rangers, not Winnipeg. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1826	According to the table, the format of Season 6 is shown to be "h77" in row 6. Therefore, the statement "the format of season 6 is q145" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1827	The statement you provided is not supported by the table of data provided. The table only goes up to season 5 and there is no episode with format q245. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusion about the format of season 6.0 from the information in the table.
1828	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that episode 223 has Q146 format, whereas episode 225 has Q147 format. Therefore, 223 was not the only episode number with Q147 format.
1829	The statement "Anne Street has no major junctions in the milepost" is supported by the table. In row 3, under "Roads Intersected" and "(No Major Junctions)", there is no mention of any major junction intersecting with Anne Street. Therefore, the statement aligns with the information presented in the table.
1830	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the location of North Avenue Plain Street Market Street appears twice with different milepost values: 12.2 and 12.8.
1831	Yes, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue are located in Norfolk County, Stoughton, and intersect with Route 24 at milepost 20. This means that Route 24 intersects with Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue as stated in the statement.
1832	Supported. Looking at row 4 and row 5 of the table, we can see that the location "Rockland" is indeed listed, and the mileposts for "North Avenue Plain Street Market Street" are given as 12.2 and 12.8 respectively. Therefore, the statement "12.8 is one of the mileposts listed for the location Rockland" is supported by the information in the table.
1833	The statement "Anne Street is located in Plymouth County and has no major junctions for mileposts or roads intersected" is supported by the table provided. According to the table, row 3 states that Anne Street is located in Norfolk, which is displayed incorrectly - it is located in Weymouth which is in Plymouth County. The other information in that row confirms that there are no major junctions listed for mileposts or roads intersected.
1834	Based on the information in the table, the statement "Plymouth County has two locations, Rockland and Stoughton" is not entirely accurate. While Route 139 does pass through Rockland and Stoughton, it also passes through other counties and locations, such as Weymouth and Hanover. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1835	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "hanover in plymouth county intersects route 123" is supported. Row 4 and 5 indicate that the town of Rockland, located in Plymouth County, is where Route 139 and Route 123 intersect. Additionally, Row 6 indicates that Hanover Street in Plymouth intersects with Route 53, which is located further north of the intersection of Route 139 and Route 123 in Rockland. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1836	The statement "milepost 12.8 is at Weymouth" is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, milepost 12.8 is located in Plymouth, specifically at the intersection of North Avenue, Plain Street, and Market Street, where it intersects with Route 123.Row 5 of the table indicates that: Plymouth | Rockland | North Avenue Plain Street Market Street | 12.8 | Route 123. Therefore, milepost 12.8 is located in Plymouth rather than in Weymouth.
1837	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Diego Milito made his debut in 2008 and scored 86 goals. As per row 9, Diego Milito made his debut in 2008 and has scored 86 goals, which is the same information mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1838	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Luca Toni has 258 apps, which is listed in the "apps" column under row 5. Additionally, his all-time rank of 53 is listed in the "all-time rank" column under row 4. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1839	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Diego Milito scored 86 goals and his debut year was in fact 2008 when he played for Inter.
1840	The statement you provided is true. The person with an all-time rank of 53 is Luca Toni and he had 258 apps listed in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1841	I'm sorry, but I cannot support or refute the statement using the given table alone. The table provides data on the top 10 football players in Italian football history in terms of goals scored, debut year, current club, and other stats. However, it does not provide any information regarding the total number of goals scored in a particular year for a specific player. Therefore, I cannot verify if the statement "0 goals occurred with Diego Milito in a debut year before 2008" is true or false.
1842	Refuted. According to the table, Sergio Pellissier, who plays for Chievo, has scored a total of 86 goals which ties him for 8th place in the all-time rank. However, there is no information in the table indicating that Chievo is the club which debuted after 1999, so the statement cannot be proven or disproven based on the information provided in the table.
1843	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided. The table only provides data on the top ten football goal scorers in Italy, and does not include information on the debut year of Mirko Vučinić or any other player not listed in the table. Additionally, the table does not include information on the debut years of any of the players listed in the table except for Francesco Totti, whose debut year is listed as 1992. Therefore, I cannot confirm or deny whether Mirko Vučinić scored any goals in a debut year later than 2008 based on the information provided in the table.
1844	According to the provided table, the statement is supported. Row 10 of the table shows that the team Beira-Mar was in the 10th position in the table, and the manner of departure was resigned. The date of vacancy for that position was 28th February 2011, which aligns with the statement given. Therefore, we can say that the provided table supports the statement - "the date of vacancy when the position in the table is 10th and the manner of departure was resigned is 28th February 2011".
1845	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the team Portimonense had a date of vacancy on 28 December 2010 (row 7). The incoming head coach for Portimonense was Carlos Azenha and he was appointed on 29 December 2010 (row 7). There is no mention of Portimonense having a vacancy or any changes in coaching staff in December 2011 in the table.
1846	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, when the team is União de Leiria, the date of appointment for the incoming head coach, Pedro Caixinha, is indeed 10 July 2010. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1847	The statement is not supported by the table, as the latest date of vacancy listed is March 1, 2011 (for Manuel Fernandes at Vitória de Setúbal), and the latest incoming head coach is also listed as March 1, 2011 (for Bruno Ribeiro at Vitória de Setúbal). The date of vacancy for Carlos Azenha at Portimonense is listed as December 28, 2010, which is prior to the latest date listed in the table.
1848	Based on the table given, the statement is refuted. The team in row 2 is indeed União de Leiria, but the date of appointment of their incoming head coach, Pedro Caixinha, is on 10 July 2010, which is after 7 July 2010 when the outgoing head coach, Lito Vidigal, was sacked. So, the date of appointment is not before 10 July 2010.
1849	Based on the information in the table, the statement that "episode no 53 in the series was directed by Paul Holahan" is supported. The episode titled "Compromising Positions" had a production code of "bcw407" and was directed by Paul Holahan, which is listed in row 8 of the table.
1850	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "Parting Shots," which was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, has the production code of "bcw404." Therefore, the production code for the episode directed by Robert Duncan McNeill is "bcw404."
1851	The statement "bcw410 is the production code for episode 10" is supported by the information in the table. In row 11 of the table, we can see that the production code listed is "bcw410", which corresponds to the 10th episode of the season. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
1852	The statement "episode 11 had 2.77 million US viewers" is supported by the information in the given table. Episode 11, titled "Family Business," had a US viewership of 2.77 million, as shown in row 12 of the table.
1853	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement is not accurate. Although Paul Holahan directed several episodes in seasons 1-6, he also directed an episode (Compromising Positions) in season 4, which aired on August 28, 2012. Therefore, the statement that Paul Holahan only directed episodes for seasons 1 through season 6 is refuted by the information in the table.
1854	The statement is refuted by the table. The production code for the episode "Parting Shots" directed by Robert Duncan McNeill is not BCW403, but actually BCW404 as can be seen in row 4 of the given table.
1855	The statement is supported by the information in the table. Episode number 10 of the season is listed on row 11 with the production code "bcw410" and an air date of "september 11 , 2012".
1856	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the 57th episode in the series titled "Family Business" had 2.77 million US viewers. There is a significant difference between 2.75 thousand viewers and 2.77 million viewers, so the statement is refuted by the information in the table.
1857	The table shows that there is no information about the post-season record for the Lexington Legends in the 2013 season. However, we know that the MLB affiliate for the team was Kansas City in that season, which means that the statement "Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013" may be supported by the table, as it appears that the Lexington Legends did not have any post-season games while they were affiliated with Kansas City. However, we cannot say for sure whether Kansas City as an organization had no post-season record in 2013 based solely on the information provided in the table.
1858	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "Houston had no post-season record" is refuted. The table shows that the following Lexington Legends teams had a post-season record while they were affiliated with the Houston Astros: - 2001: 4-0, 1.000- 2003: 0-2, 000- 2006: 0-2, 000These records indicate that the Lexington Legends had a post-season record while they were affiliated with the Houston Astros.
1859	Based on the information given in the table, the statement is supported. Row 6 of the table indicates that the Buffalo Bills selected John Nies with pick number 155, and that his position is punter, and that he played for Arizona. Therefore, the statement that "draft pick number 155 comes from Arizona university" is true according to the given table.
1860	The statement "Arizona is the college who has the last draft pick" is refuted by the table as there are two colleges listed after Arizona in the table: Minnesota-Duluth and Carson-Newman. Therefore, Arizona did not have the last draft pick in the 1990 draft.
1861	The statement "the one where everybody finds out is episode number 111.0" is supported by the table. The episode "The One Where Everybody Finds Out" is listed as episode number 111 (row 15) in the table under the "no in series" column, which confirms that it is the 11th episode of the fifth season.
1862	The statement "episode 11, the one with all the resolutions, aired on the 7th of January, 1999" is supported by the table. Row 12 of the table shows that episode 11 of Friends season 5, titled "The One with All the Resolutions," was aired on January 7, 1999.
1863	That statement is refuted by the table. The production code 467671 is assigned to the episode titled "The One with the Ball" which aired on May 6, 1999, and had 20.9 million US viewers, not 24.8 million.
1864	The statement is NOT supported by the table. According to the table, "The One with All the Kissing" was the episode that originally aired on October 1, 1998. "The One with All the Resolutions" aired on January 7, 1999. Therefore, the statement that "October 1, 1998 was the date that The One with All the Resolutions originally aired" is refuted by the information given in the table.
1865	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. According to the table, the episode that had 23.9 million US viewers was "The One with All the Thanksgivings," which had a production code of 467659. Therefore, the correct statement is: "The production code for the episode that had 23.9 million US viewers was 467659."
1866	Yes, the statement "16.22 (118) was the away team score against a home team score of 20.20 (140)" is supported by the table. Looking at row 5 of the table, we can see that Hawthorn was the home team, and they scored 20.20 (140) while Collingwood was the away team, and they scored 16.22 (118). Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1867	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 3 of the table, the home team Fitzroy's score was indeed 21.16 (142) in their game against St Kilda on 7th August 1982 at Junction Oval.
1868	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table, as there is no row where the away team scored 16.22 (118). The highest away team score listed in the table is 16.16 (112) by Richmond, and the corresponding home team score is 7.8 (50) by Footscray, which is not the highest score in the table. Therefore, this statement cannot be verified or falsified by the given table for the 1982 vfl season.
1869	The statement "21.16 (142) home team score had an away team of Fitzroy" is supported by the table. In row 3 of the table, we see that Fitzroy played against St Kilda at Junction Oval on August 7th, 1982, and their score was 11.12 (78) while Fitzroy's score was 21.16 (142). Therefore, the statement is correct, and it is supported by the information in the table.
1870	The statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. There is no skip named Ron MacDonald in the table. However, there is a skip named Rod Macdonald from Prince Edward Island, who had a PF (points for) of 67 and  ends lost of 5, which is different from the value mentioned in the statement (51).
1871	The statement "Skip Jean-Michel Ménard has a shot pct of 80% and 8 blank ends" is supported by the information presented in the table. In the table, we can see that in the row representing Quebec, Skip Jean-Michel Ménard has a shot percentage of 80%, which is the same as the claimed percentage in the statement. Additionally, in the row representing Quebec, we can see that they had 8 blank ends, which is also consistent with the statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is supported by the table.
1872	Refuted. Looking at the table, we can see that the lowest number of blank ends (7) occurs when the win (w) is 8 for team Ontario. It's also important to note that team Ontario achieved this number of blank ends with a win (w) of 6. Therefore, we can say that the statement "10 is the lowest value of blank ends when the win (w) is 6" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1873	I'm sorry, but the statement "48 is the value of ends lost when the blank ends is 9" cannot be proven or disproven based on the information provided in the table. The table does not have a row where there are 9 blank ends, so there is no way to determine the corresponding value for ends lost. Additionally, the table does not contain any direct relationship or calculation between blank ends and ends lost.
1874	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided cannot be verified or refuted based on the information provided in the table. The table provides information on the performance of different teams at the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier, including their win-loss record, points for (PF), points against (PA), ends won and lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot percentage. There is no information in the table that directly correlates a PF of 67 with an ends lost score of 40. If you have any other queries or information that you want me to check against the table, please let me know.
1875	I apologize, but the information required to support or refute the statement you provided is not present in the table. The table only provides information on the win-loss record, points scored, ends won and lost, as well as other statistics for each team participating in the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. There is no column present in the table that measures the shot percentage of each team or relates it to the number of blank ends. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1876	The statement "Alberta is the locale when l is 9" is supported by the information in the table. Looking at the "locale" column, we see that the row with "l" equal to 9 is the first row, and the corresponding "locale" value in that row is "Alberta". Therefore, the statement is true based on the information in the table.
1877	I apologize, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table. The value of "blank ends" and "stolen ends" are provided separately for each team in the table, but there is no specific combination where "stolen ends" equals 7 and "blank ends" equals 46. Therefore, the statement cannot be evaluated based on the information provided in the table.
1878	I apologize, but I cannot support or refute the statement "46 is the value of ends lost when blank ends is 9" based on the table you provided. The table does not contain any information that can indicate the values of ends lost or blank ends being correlated or having any relationship. Therefore, I cannot verify the accuracy of this statement based on the table.
1879	The statement is supported by the table. In row 4, it is stated that the settlement of Lok has a population of 1114. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
1880	Supported. According to the table provided, "Lok" is listed in the "settlement" column as a type of "village" in Vojvodina. Therefore, the statement "the settlement of lok is a village" is supported by the table.
1881	Based on the information in the table, the statement "the settlements Titel and Lok differ only in population" is supported. Both Titel and Lok are listed as villages and have a Serb majority population, and dominant religion of orthodox Christianity. However, Titel has a population of 5294, while Lok has a population of 1114, showing a significant difference in population size between the two settlements.
1882	The statement "Gardinovci had the smallest population in 2011." is supported by the table. According to the table, Gardinovci had a population of 1297 in 2011, which is lower than the populations of Titel (5294), Lok (1114), Mošorin (2569) and Šajkaš (4374). Therefore, the statement that Gardinovci had the smallest population is correct.
1883	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. In the table, the candidate Paul Findley is listed as the incumbent representing Illinois's 20th district in the United States House of Representatives. His party is listed as Republican, and the column "first elected" shows the year 1960. Furthermore, in the row for Illinois's 20th district, under the "result" column, it indicates that Paul Findley was re-elected in 1980. Therefore, the statement "Republican Paul Findley was first elected in 1960" is supported by the table.
1884	The statement "Republican Phil Crane was first elected in 1969" is supported by the information presented in the table. In row 5, it can be seen that Phil Crane, the Republican incumbent, was re-elected in Illinois' 12th district in 1980. According to the table, he was first elected in 1969, which means that he was serving his fifth term in the House of Representatives in 1980.
1885	The statement is supported by the table. The information in row 3 of the table states that Henry Hyde was the Republican incumbent in the Illinois 6th district who was re-elected in 1980, with 67.0% of the votes. In the same row, it is also mentioned that his opponent was Democrat Mario Reymond Reda, who received 33.0% of the votes. Therefore, the statement is true and supported by the information presented in the table.
1886	The statement "Paul Findley, district Illinois 20, was first elected after Henry Hyde, district Illinois 6." is refuted by the table. According to the table, Paul Findley was first elected in 1960, while Henry Hyde was first elected in 1974. Therefore, Paul Findley was actually elected before Henry Hyde.
1887	The statement "Cardiss Collins was first elected as a Democrat in 1969" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Cardiss Collins was re-elected as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives elections in 1980 from Illinois's 7th congressional district. However, her first election to the House of Representatives was in a special election held on March 31, 1973, after the seat was vacated by her husband after his death. Therefore, she was not first elected as a Democrat in 1969.
1888	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Phil Crane was a Republican and he won the 1980 House of Representatives election in the 12th district of Illinois by defeating the Democratic candidate David McCartney. Additionally, Henry Hyde is listed in the table as the incumbent Republican representative for the 6th district of Illinois who was re-elected in 1980, defeating the Democratic candidate Mario Reymond Reda. Therefore, the statement that "in 1974 Republican Phil Crane beat Henry Hyde who was a Democrat" is incorrect and is not supported by the table.
1889	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9 in the table, during the season 2000-1, Kanto Gakuin University was the winner of the All-Japan University Rugby Championship, and the title of the championship during the season was the 37th. Furthermore, the table shows that the championship was held at the National Stadium in Tokyo, and the attendance information is not available (n/a). Therefore, the statement is accurate and supported by the table.
1890	The statement is supported by the table. The 32nd All-Japan University Rugby Championship was held in the National Stadium, Tokyo venue, during the season 1995-6 details. Meiji won the championship by defeating Waseda in the final, confirming that Waseda was the runner-up.
1891	The statement says that the 2010-11 season has a title of 47th and the runner-up was Waseda. Looking at the table, we can see that the 47th season is indeed the 2010-11 season. However, the runner-up for that particular season was not Waseda, but rather it was Meiji, as they lost in the championship game to Teikyo. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1892	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 4 of the table, in the 32nd season of the All-Japan University Rugby Championship (1995-6), Meiji won the championship with a score of 43-9, while Waseda was the runner-up.
1893	The statement you provided is incorrect. According to the table, the 37th All-Japan University Rugby Championship occurred during the 2000-2001 season, where Kanto Gakuin University was the winner with an attendance of n/a. The winner of the 47th All-Japan University Rugby Championship during the 2010-2011 season was Teikyo University, with an attendance of 25,458 and a title of the 47th. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1894	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that the 47th All-Japan University Rugby Championship took place during the 2010-11 season, and that the winner was Teikyo University. However, the table does not list Tokai University as the runner-up for the 47th championship. Instead, it shows that Waseda University was the runner-up for the 47th championship, losing to Teikyo in the final. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table as it mentions the incorrect runner-up for the 47th All-Japan University Rugby Championship.
1895	The statement is refuted by the information provided in the table. According to the table, in the 48th season of the All-Japan University Rugby Championship, Teikyo was the winner with a score of 15-12, and Tenri was not the runner-up in that game.
1896	The statement you've provided is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the 32nd championship took place in the 1995-1996 season, and Meiji was the winner with a score of 43-9 against Waseda. Hosei is not mentioned in this championship, and there is no record of Meiji being the loser in the 32nd championship game. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1897	The table shows that the Oakland Raiders played against the New Orleans Saints in the 11th week and lost 13-10. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
1898	According to the table, the attendance for Week 3 was 47,922 while the attendance for Week 4 was 72,586, which means that the statement is supported by the table. Week 4 had a higher attendance than Week 3.
1899	I apologize, but I think there's an error in your statement. According to the table, the game against the New Orleans Saints took place on November 9, 1997, not November 29, 1997.That being said, to answer your question: the statement "on November 9, 1997, when the New Orleans Saints were the opponents, has the least attendance of the season" is refuted by the table. The game against the New Orleans Saints had an attendance of 40,091, but the game against the Tennessee Oilers (on August 31, 1997) had the lowest attendance of the season with only 30,171 people in attendance.
1900	The statement is supported by the table. According to the "2013-1975 Cleveland International Piano Competition" table, Antonio Pompa-Baldi from Italy was the first position winner in the year 1999. The table's ninth row shows that he won the competition in 1999, followed by Vassily Primakov from Russia in second position, Shoko Inoue from Japan in third position, and Sean Botkin from the USA in fourth position.
1901	No, the statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that in the 1991 Cleveland International Piano Competition, Jean-Francois Bouvery from France was placed third, and Anders Martinson from the USA was placed second. Therefore, Bouvery is not fourth when Martinson is second.
1902	The statement that "Antonio Pompa-Baldi Italy was first in 1999 and 2000" is not supported by the table. In 1999, Pompa-Baldi was the first-place winner of the Cleveland International Piano Competition, but there is no year mentioned in the table where he would have won first place again in that competition.
1903	The statement is not supported by the table. There is no mention of Jean-François Bouvery or Anders Martinson in the 1975 row of the table. Therefore, we cannot determine if Jean-François Bouvery came in 4th place and Anders Martinson came in 2nd place in the 1975 Cleveland International Piano Competition from the given table.
1904	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table shows that in the year 2000, a steam buggy themed coin by artist John Mardon was issued with a mintage of 44,367 and an issue price of 59.95.
1905	The statement "the theme of d - 10 locomotive by artist Dan Fell was from 2002" is supported by the table. As per the table, the row 10 shows that the theme of the D-10 locomotive coin was part of the 2002 series of Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins. This coin was created by artist Dan Fell and was included as a part of the Gray-Dort coin series. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data presented in the table.
1906	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 11 in the table, the coin "HMCS Bras Dor" with a mintage of 31997 had an issue price of $59.95. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1907	I'm sorry, but the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table. The table shows that in the year 2000, there were three different numismatic coins issued: the Steam Buggy, the Bluenose, and the Toronto. The Steam Buggy had a theme of "Steam Buggy" with an artist of John Mardon and a mintage of 44,367. The Bluenose and the Toronto were both included in the Steam Buggy issue and did not have their own separate mintage. The Bluenose had an artist of J. Franklin Wright, and the Toronto had an artist of John Mardon. There is no mention of a Bricklin SV-1 theme in any of these coins, nor is there any indication that John Mardon's artwork was used for a Bricklin SV-1 theme in any other year.
1908	Refuted. The table does not mention any coin designed by Dan Fell in the year 2003, nor does it mention any coin with his name as the artist. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that Dan Fell's coin was released in 2003.
1909	Refuted. The artist with a mintage of 41828 is John Mardon, not Bonnie Ross. Bonnie Ross is listed in the table as the artist for "The William Lawrence" numismatic coin, which is included in the "The Gray - Dort" coin set.
1910	Refuted. The 31997 mintage is associated with the "HMCS Bras D'or" coin and was released in 2003, according to the table.
1911	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 5 of the table lists Shabazz Muhammad, indicating that he attended Bishop Gorman High School, located in Las Vegas, NV. The table also shows that Muhammad's college was UCLA, which confirms that he attended that school. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we can confirm that Shabazz Muhammad attended UCLA and his hometown is Las Vegas, NV.
1912	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 5 of the table, the player from Bishop Gorman High School who attends UCLA is Shabazz Muhammad, and his hometown is listed as Las Vegas, NV.
1913	The statement "Perry Ellis went to Wichita Heights High School, and attended Kansas college" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Perry Ellis is listed in row 3, and the information provided in his row matches the statement. Specifically, it shows that Perry Ellis, who is listed at a height of 6'8", attended Wichita Heights High School in Wichita, KS, and went on to attend college at Kansas. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information included in the table.
1914	The statement "Cody Zeller went to Washington High School, and his hometown is Washington, IN" is supported by the information in the table. Row 6 of the table states that Cody Zeller went to Washington High School and his hometown is Washington, IN.
1915	The statement "Cody Zeller's hometown is Washington, IN" is supported by the information in the table. In row 6 of the table, it is mentioned that Cody Zeller attended Washington High School, which is located in Washington, IN. Therefore, we can conclude that Cody Zeller's hometown is Washington, IN.
1916	The statement is supported by the table provided. The last player on the list is Cody Zeller, whose hometown is listed as Washington, IN. The player before him, Shabazz Muhammad, has a hometown listed as Las Vegas, NV. Therefore, the statement "the hometown of the last player of the list is Las Vegas, NV" is true with regards to the 6 players listed in the table.
1917	The statement is refuted by the information presented in the table. The table shows that the player named Shabazz Muhammad stands at 6'6" in height, and he is from Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, NV. Additionally, the table does not provide any information that another player from the table, who may be 6'11" in height, is from Jersey City, NJ.
1918	The statement "Kansas college is getting a player that attended St. Anthony High School" is refuted by the information in the table. While there is a player from St. Anthony High School listed in the table (Myles Mack), he did not go to college at Kansas. Mack is listed as attending Rutgers University, which means that the statement is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1919	The statement, "the home town of Cody Zeller is Wichita, KS," is refuted by the table. According to the table, the hometown of Cody Zeller is Washington, IN.
1920	The statement "the hometown of Cody Zeller is Wichita, KS" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the hometown of Cody Zeller is actually Washington, IN. Therefore, Wichita, KS is not Cody Zeller's hometown.
1921	The statement "Joe Germanese was the 27th pick" is supported by the table. According to the table, the 27th pick was Joe Germanese, who was selected by the New England Revolution.
1922	The statement "Jonathan Leathers was picked 25th" is supported by the table. In row 12, we can see that "Jonathan Leathers" is listed as the player picked with the 25th overall pick by the Kansas City Wizards.
1923	This statement is refuted by the information in the table. Joe Germanese is listed as the player selected at pick number 27, not pick number 24. Therefore, the statement is false.
1924	The statement "Peter Lowry's pick number was 25" is refuted by the information in the table. According to the table, Peter Lowry was actually picked at number 26 by the Chicago Fire.
1925	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, Michael Schumacher is the driver whose constructor is Ferrari, and he started the race from the first grid position. He completed 60 laps and finished the race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, and 35.101 seconds. Therefore, the statement that Michael Schumacher is the driver whose constructor is Ferrari and has an average grid number of 1 with time / retired of 1:32:35.101 is supported by the information presented in the table.
1926	Supported. According to the table, in Week 3 of the 1970 New York Giants season, the New York Giants played the New Orleans Saints at Tulane Stadium, as indicated by "3| 1970 - 10 - 04| new orleans saints| l 14 - 10| tulane stadium| 69126" in the table. Therefore, the statement "The New Orleans Saints played before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium" is supported by the information in the table.
1927	The statement "the week 1 game had an attendance of 62936" is supported by the information in the table. Looking at row 2, we can see that the game took place in week 1 against the Chicago Bears and the attendance was indeed 62936.
1928	The statement is refuted by the table. The Buffalo Bills did play against the New York Giants in Week 12 at Yankee Stadium, but they did not have a game before Week 7 in Tulane Stadium at the Dallas Cowboys. In fact, the Giants played against the New Orleans Saints in Week 3 at Tulane Stadium.
1929	Based on the table you provided, we can see that in week 1, the New York Giants played against the Chicago Bears at Yankee Stadium and the attendance was 62,936. However, there is no information about the attendance at other games played in the same week. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether 62,936 was the highest attendance for the whole week or not. In conclusion, the statement "62936 was the highest attendance for the whole week" is not supported nor refuted by the provided table as there's no data of attendance from other games in that week.
1930	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Twickenham Stoop was a venue on March 28, 2009, but the score in that match was 22-12 in favor of Harlequins RL, not Craig Hall's team. The table indicates that Hull Kingston Rovers played against Bradford Bulls on that day and lost with a score of 24-36.
1931	I'm sorry, but that statement is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the venue on 6 April 2007 was Twickenham Stoop, but the score was 30-28, not 22-12. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1932	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, row 10 is about Joliette and the value under the "water (sqmi)" column is 0.771, which matches the statement that Joliette has 0.771 square miles of water. Additionally, the value under the "geo id" column for Joliette is 3806741020, which also matches the statement that it can be found with geo id 3806741020. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1933	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Geo ID for Janke Township in Logan County is 3804740620.
1934	Based on the information available in the table, the statement "grand forks county has 36.199 square miles of land" is supported. The table shows that the township of Johnstown, which is located in Grand Forks County, has a land area of 36.199 square miles, as indicated in the "land (sqmi)" column of row 9.
1935	Supported. According to the table, Joliette township has a geo id of 3806741020.
1936	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to the table, James Hill township has 4.243 sqmi of water and a latitude of 48.423125.
1937	The statement is supported by the table. As per the data in the table, the township named "James River Valley" is located in Dickey County, and has 28.597 sqmi of land. This information is listed in row 4 of the table. Therefore, the statement that "the township that has 28.597 sqmi of land is that of James River Valley" appears to be accurate based on the information provided in the table.
1938	I'm sorry, but the table you provided does not support the statement "the geo id for a township with 0.717 square miles of water is 3806741020." None of the townships listed in the table have 0.717 square miles of water. The township with the most water is James Hill, with 4.243 square miles of water, but its geo id is 3806140500, not 3806741020. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1939	The statement "the geo id for dickey county is 3804740620" is refuted by the information in the table. While Dickey county is listed in row 4 along with its township "James River Valley", its geo id is listed as "3802140540", not "3804740620".
1940	Refuted. According to the table, the township of Jackson is in the Sargent county, not the Mountrail county.
1941	Supported. According to the table, the geo id for Johnstown is indeed listed as 3810340820 in row 8. Therefore, the statement "the geo id for Johnstown is 3810340820" is supported by the table.
1942	Sorry, but the statement "James Hill has the least amount of land (sqmi)" is not supported by the table. From the given table, we can see that James Hill township has 31.82 sqmi of land, but there are two other townships, namely Jim River Valley and James River Valley, which have less land area as compared to James Hill. Jim River Valley has 34.134 sqmi and James River Valley has 28.597 sqmi of land. Thus, James Hill is not the township with the least amount of land area, it is third in the list. Therefore, the statement "James Hill has the least amount of land (sqmi)" is refuted by the table.
1943	I'm sorry, but the statement that "the latitude for the township janke is - 97.945530" is not supported by the information in the table. According to the table, the latitude for the township Janke is 46.415512, which is significantly different from the value stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the data in the table.
1944	The statement "the class of Undine was withdrawn in years 1884 - 1886" is supported by the table. According to row 13 in the table, the Undine belonged to the 2-4-0 wheel arrangement class and was manufactured by Nine Elms Works in 1859-60. The table shows that the Undine was withdrawn in the years 1884-1886 along with its 12 counterparts in the same class.
1945	The statement that "for the class Vesuvius with a wheel arrangement of 2 - 4 - 0, the quantity made was 32, and the quantity preserved was 0" is supported by the information in the table. Row 23 in the table shows that the class Vesuvius has a wheel arrangement of 2 - 4 - 0, a total of 32 were made from 1869 - 1875, and none of them have been preserved. Therefore, the statement is accurate based on the information provided in the table.
1946	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 3 of the table, under the "Class," "Wheel arrangement," and "Manufacturer" columns, it can be seen that the class "Hercules" has a wheel arrangement of "2 - 4 - 0" and was manufactured by "Nine Elms Works." Therefore, the statement that "for the class Hercules, with wheel arrangement 2 - 4 - 0, the manufacturer was Nine Elms Works" is supported by the information in the table.
1947	Based on the table, the statement is refuted. The table shows that Nine Elms Works manufactured a locomotive named Undine with a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement from 1859-60 and was withdrawn in 1884-1886.
1948	The statement is partially supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that there is a locomotive named Eagle, which belongs to the 2-4-0 wheel arrangement and was manufactured by Nine Elms Works in the year 1862. The table also indicates that there were three locomotives made in this class. However, the table contradicts the statement by showing that there were three locomotives made in the Eagle class, not 15 as the statement claims. Unfortunately, the table does not explicitly mention whether any of the Eagle class locomotives were preserved or not, so we cannot conclude whether the statement is entirely true or false.
1949	According to the table, Hercules was manufactured by Nine Elms Works between 1851 and 1854. Additionally, it was withdrawn from service between 1875 and 1884. Therefore, the year for Hercules was NOT only 1872 - 1884 but it was in service between 1851 and 1854 and then withdrawn from service between 1875 and 1884.
1950	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the row with county listed as "Vest", the exports (us mil) are 6270.2, which is the same number as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information presented in the table.
1951	The statement is supported by the table. The second row of the table shows that Bucharest-Ilfov has exports worth $8001.2 million, and that Vest county has exports worth $6270.2 million, accounting for 15.0% of the total exports. Therefore, it can be concluded that Vest county makes $6270.2 million in exports.
1952	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Vest county has exports of 6270.2 (in US million) and a percent of total exports of 15.0%. Therefore Vest county's exports were 6270.2 and accounted for 13.8% of the total exports in Romania (as stated in the statement).
1953	Based on the table provided, the statement "for Centru county, the percentage of total exports is 13.8% and the percentage of total imports is 11.8%" is refuted. According to the table, the percentage of total exports for Centru county is 12.8%, not 13.8%, and the percentage of total imports is 11.8%, not 11.2%.
1954	The statement "the exports for the country of sud - vest oltenia is 26557.8" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the exports of sud-vest Oltenia are only 3226.2 million US dollars, while the number 26557.8 million US dollars is actually the amount of imports that Bucharest-Ilfov County has received.
1955	I apologize, but the table you provided does not have a row for February 21. The closest dates are February 19 ("row 10: 62| 19| boston bruins| 3 - 4| 31 - 15 - 11 - 5| 78") and February 24 ("row 12: 64| 24| chicago blackhawks| 3 - 1| 33 - 15 - 11 - 5| 82"). Therefore, the statement "February 21 had a score of 5 - 4" cannot be supported or refuted by the information in the table.
1956	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "the score was 5 - 4 on February 24" appears to be false. The table shows that the Philadelphia Flyers played against the Chicago Blackhawks on February 24, game number 64, and the score was 3-1 in favor of the Flyers, not 5-4.
1957	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 7 of the table, on 10 March 1984, Birmingham City played against Watford as the home team, and the score of the game was 1-3 to Watford.
1958	The statement is not supported by the table as it shows that Plymouth Argyle played against Derby County on March 10, 1984, and then there was a replay match on March 14, 1984, where Derby County lost to Plymouth Argyle. However, there is no record of any match taking place between Plymouth Argyle and Derby County on March 19, 1984, in the given table.
1959	The statement "with a tie no 2, Sheffield Wednesday is the home team" is supported by the information in the table. According to row 2 of the table, tie no. 2 is Sheffield Wednesday vs. Southampton, and Sheffield Wednesday is listed as the home team.
1960	The statement "the score of the Sheffield Wednesday versus Southampton game was 0 - 0" is supported by the table. As per the table, in the second tie, played on March 11, 1984, Sheffield Wednesday played against Southampton, and the score was 0-0. This information is reflected in row 3 of the table.
1961	The statement is supported by the table as shown in row 7 where Birmingham City was the home team and the away team was Watford, and the score was Birmingham City 1 - 3 Watford on 10th March 1984.
1962	The statement is supported by the information presented in the table. According to row 6 of the table, Plymouth Argyle played against Derby County in a replay match on 14 March 1984. Therefore, Plymouth Argyle faced the away team (Derby County) after 14 March 1984, which means that the statement is true.
1963	The statement is not supported by the table. Birmingham City was the home team in Tie No. 4 against Watford on March 10, 1984, and the score of that game was Birmingham City 1 - 3 Watford, which can be confirmed in row 7 of the table. Therefore, the score of the game when Birmingham City was the home team was not 0 - 0.
1964	The statement "4 - 1 was the 2nd leg for 2004" is supported by the table. In Row 18, we see that the Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty in 2004 was won by San José de los Arroyos with a final aggregate score of 4-3 against Durazno. The first leg resulted in a 0-2 defeat for San José de los Arroyos, but they managed to win the second leg 4-1. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided in the table.
1965	The statement is supported by the information in the table. According to row 9 in the table, in the year 1984, San Pedro was the winner of the Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty, and in their final against Rocha, the score of the 2nd leg was indeed 3 - 0, which means that the statement is supported by the table.
1966	The statement is refuted by the table. The information given in the table for the "2004" row in the fourth column shows "0 - 2" for the 1st leg, which means that the score was 0-2, rather than 4-1 as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement "4 - 1 was the 1st leg for 2004" is incorrect based on the information presented in the table.
1967	The statement seems to refer to the match between San Pedro and Rocha in 1984, according to row 9 in the table. The table shows that the aggregate score was 4-3 with San Pedro winning, but it doesn't provide information about the specific score in the second leg of the match. Therefore, we can't determine if the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1968	The statement is supported by the table. Row 29 in the table lists "Danny Cipriani" under the "Fly-half" position, and shows his date of birth as "2 November 1987".
1969	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The player born on 2 November 1987 is Danny Cipriani, who played fly-half and is the only player from Sale Sharks in the 2008 Six Nations Championship squad.
1970	The statement about Steve Borthwick is not supported by the table of 2008 six nations championship squads. Steve Borthwick is listed in the table as a lock and not a prop. Additionally, the table does not mention any affiliation of Steve Borthwick with Leicester, so it cannot be determined whether he is their best-known player in the lock position.
1971	Actually, the statement you provided is not correct. The table shows that Ai Miyazato participated in the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open twice, and she won the tournament as an amateur in 2003 (row 2) and finished in second place in 2006 with a score of 214 (row 14). However, in neither of these performances, did she end two points under par. In 2003, she won the tournament with a score of 5 under par, while in 2006, she finished the tournament with a score of 2 under par, which was 4 strokes behind the winner's score. Therefore, the statement "the winner of the miyagi tv cup donlop ladies open ended two point under par ( - 2)" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
1972	The statement is supported by the table. In row 7, it shows that Ai Miyazato won the Vernal Ladies tournament with a winning score of 203. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information presented in the table.
1973	The statement is supported by the information in the table. In row 2, it can be seen that Ai Miyazato won the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open with a winning score of 211 and a margin of victory of 1 stroke over Mari Katayama and Hiroko Yamaguchi. Therefore, the statement that the winner of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open had a 3-stroke margin of victory is not accurate.
1974	I apologize, but the statement you provided is incorrect. There is no record of the Vernal Ladies tournament in the table provided, and the winning score of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open in September 2006 was 214, not 203. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1975	The statement "the ar - 15a3 competition hbar has a barrel length of 16 in" is supported by the information presented in the table. Row 19 shows that the AR-15A3 competition HBAR has a barrel length of 16 in.
1976	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the sporter target has an s-1 fire control" is not entirely supported or refuted. The table does contain a row for the Sporter Target (r6551), which lists an A2 rear sight and 1:7 barrel twist, but there is no information provided on the type of fire control used in this model. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not the Sporter Target has an S-1 fire control based on the information in the table.
1977	Based on the information in the table, this statement is refuted. The fire control for the Sporter Target (r6551) is listed as "s - 1", not "a1".
1978	Based on the information in the table, we can see that North Melbourne's away opponent was actually St Kilda, not their home opponent. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1979	The statement "Carlton scored 20.7 when they played Richmond at Princes Park" is supported by the table. In the table, in row 4, we can see that Carlton was the home team and they scored 20.7 (127) while playing against Richmond who scored 24.12 (156) at Princes Park on 23rd August 1969.
1980	The statement is refuted by the table. The home team and the away team scores on the row for the match played at Western Oval on August 23, 1969, were Footscray 14.10 (94) and Essendon 12.10 (82), respectively. The correct home team score for that match was 14.10 (94) and not 14.13 (97) as stated in the statement.
1981	Based on the table provided, the statement "Collingwood's home opponent was St Kilda" is refuted. The table shows that Collingwood's home opponent for the round played on 23 August 1969 was South Melbourne, as evidenced by Row 3, which states "Collingwood, 19.15 (129), South Melbourne, 6.22 (58), Victoria Park, 19428, 23 August 1969." The table does show St Kilda playing at home on the same day, defeating North Melbourne at Moorabbin Oval, but there is no indication that they played against Collingwood.
1982	The statement you provided is not supported by the table. According to the table, the vfl game that was played at Princes Park on 23 August 1969 was between Carlton (the home team) and Richmond (the away team), and the final score was 20.7 (127) for Carlton and 24.12 (156) for Richmond. Therefore, the home team score at Princes Park during the 1969 vfl season was 20.7 (127), not 21.18 (144).
1983	According to the table, the at90s1200 chip has a frequency of 12, which supports the statement that "the at90s1200 chip has a frequency of 12 mhz". Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1984	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement is supported. Specifically, row 2 shows that the package is PDIP-20, and the EEPROM size is 64, which is less than 128. Therefore, this instance confirms the statement that the package is PDIP-20 when the EEPROM size is less than 128.
1985	The statement "at90s1200 is the chip with the smallest frequency of more than 12 MHz" is refuted by the information provided in the table. The table shows that at90s1200 has a frequency of 12 MHz, and there are two other chips, at90s2313 and at90s / ls2323, that have a smaller frequency of 10 MHz. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.
1986	The statement "The second episode had 2.24 million US viewers" is supported by the table. According to row 3, the second episode with the title "Metallo" had a US viewership of 2.24 million.
1987	The statement "the title Rabid had 2.30 million viewers in the US" is supported by the table. In row 4, under the "US viewers (million)" column, it shows that the episode "Rabid" had a viewership rating of 2.3 million in the US.
1988	The statement "Wayne Rose had directed only one title Echo in the table" is supported by the information presented in the table. According to the table, Wayne Rose is credited as the director for only one episode, which is "Echo" (Row 4).
1989	Supported. According to the table, the episode with the title "Kandor" (season 9 episode 7) had a US viewership of 2.63 million.
1990	The statement "episode 4 was seen by 2.24 million people in the US" is supported by the table. According to the data in the table, episode 4, "Metallo," had a US viewership of 2.24 million, as seen in row 3.
1991	Unfortunately, the table doesn't provide any information related to the number of viewers in Africa. Therefore, I cannot confirm or refute the statement using the information presented in the table.
1992	The statement you provided is not supported by the table. There is only one episode, "Echo," that was directed by Wayne Rose.
1993	I'm sorry, but I cannot determine from the provided table whether the statement "2.63 million people in China saw the episode called Kandor" is supported or refuted. The table only provides information about the US air date and US viewership ratings of each episode of Smallville season 9. It does not mention any international viewership data.
1994	Based on the information presented in the table, the statement "the collingwood electorate was assigned to the nelson province" is supported. Andrew Richmond was the member elected for the Collingwood electorate, and it is listed in the table that his province was Nelson. Therefore, we can conclude that the Collingwood electorate was indeed assigned to the Nelson province during the 3rd New Zealand Parliament.
1995	According to the table, the member Andrew Richmond was elected for the electorate of Collingwood and represented the province of Nelson. Therefore, the statement "Nelson is not the province for the electorate of Collingwood" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
1996	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that "Windows Live Messenger" was released on November 17, 2010, and was developed by Microsoft. However, there is no information available in the table about the version number of the application. Additionally, the table does not have a specific category for social networking, but it does have a category called "Utilities" and another category called "Social Networking".Therefore, while the statement is mostly supported by the table, the version number and the specific category mentioned in the statement are not listed in the table.
1997	The statement "chord finder by Microsoft was released on 2010 - 11 - 17 under the category of utilities" is supported by the information in the table. The table shows that the "Chord Finder" application was developed by Microsoft, released on November 17, 2010, and was categorized as a utility application.
1998	The statement is supported by the table. The Facebook application by Matchbox was indeed released on December 16th, 2010, according to row 8 of the table.
1999	I'm sorry, but the statement is refuted by the information in the table. None of the entries match all of the criteria mentioned in the statement. The entry with the closest release date of 2010 - 11 - 17 and a developer of Microsoft and a title of "Piano" has a different category ("Entertainment") and a different version number (1.0). Similarly, the entry with a developer of Dino Games and a category of Utilities (Drum Machine HD) has a different release date of 2010 - 10 - 20, a different title, and a different version number (1.0).Therefore, the statement that "2010 - 11 - 17 is the release date of version 1.0 with a category of utilities, a developer of dino games, and a title of msn money" is refuted by the information in the table.
2000	The statement you provided is incorrect according to the table. There is a row with the release date of 2010 - 11 - 17 and a title of "Piano", but it is developed by Microsoft and falls under the entertainment category with a version of 1.0. Additionally, there is a row with a title of "Chord Finder", which is developed by Microsoft and was released on 2010 - 11 - 17, but it falls under the utilities category with a version of 1.0. Therefore, the statement you provided is not supported by the information in the table.
2001	I'm sorry, but the statement, "babaroga is the developer with a release date of 2010 - 12 - 16 and the title of facebook," is not supported by the information in the table. The developer of the Facebook app listed in the table is Matchbox, not Babaroga, and the release date for the Facebook app is 2010-12-16. Additionally, Babaroga is listed as the developer for the Fingerpaint app, which has a release date of 2011-07-29.
2002	The statement "Twitter has the version of 1.0.0.3" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Twitter has a version of 1.6 and its release date is 2010-12-16. None of the applications in the table have a version number of 1.0.0.3.
2003	The statement "CHSU-FM, owned by Bell Media, has a frequency of 99.9 FM" is supported by the information in the table. Row 7 in the table shows that "99.9 FM | CHSU-FM | 99.9 Sun FM | Contemporary Hits Radio | Bell Media" is an existing radio station in Kelowna, and its owner is clearly stated as Bell Media. So, the statement is true.
2004	The statement "the station with a frequency of 00 96.3 fm plays classic rock" is supported by the information in the table. Row 6 shows that the station with a frequency of 96.3 fm is CKKO-FM, which is branded as K96.3 and plays classic rock. Therefore, the statement is accurate according to the table given.
2005	The statement is supported by the table. According to the data presented in the table, the radio station with frequency 101.5 FM is called CILK-FM and it is identified as "101.5 EZ Rock". The table also shows that the owner of this radio station is Bell Media. Therefore, based on the information presented in the table, we can conclude that the statement "Bell media owns the radio station with frequency 0 101.5 fm" is true.
2006	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table:Frequency: 99.9 Call Sign: CHSU - FMBranding: 99.9 Sun FMFormat: Contemporary Hits RadioOwner: Bell MediaTherefore, Bell Media's call sign was CHSU - FM on the frequency 99.9 FM as stated in the statement.
2007	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that 1150 AM is associated with the branding "AM 1150" in the "branding" column.
2008	The statement is supported by the information in the table. The radio station CJUI-FM is owned by Vista Broadcast Group and plays adult hits. The table indicates that CJUI-FM is located at 103.9 FM, has the branding "103.9 The Juice," and plays adult hits. Therefore, the statement "Vista Broadcast Group's radio station plays adult hits" is supported by the information in the table.
2009	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 2 of the table, we can see that the call sign for Astral Media's radio station is CKFR, which matches the statement. Therefore, the statement is supported by the information in the table.
2010	The statement is supported by the table. Row 10 indicates that CJUI-FM, which is owned by Vista Broadcast Group, is the radio station that plays adult hits.
2011	The statement is supported by the information in the table. We can see in row 2 that "ckfr" is listed as the call sign for "am 1150" radio owned by "astral media."
2012	Based on the information provided in the table, the statement "vista broadcast group plays all types of hits" cannot be supported or refuted because there is no specific information about the formats of the stations owned by Vista Broadcast Group. The only station owned by Vista Broadcast Group listed in the table is CJUI-FM, which is identified as playing adult hits. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about the types of hits played by Vista Broadcast Group based solely on this table.
2013	The statement is refuted by the table. The call sign for Astral Media's radio station is CKFR-AM (AM 1150), and it is listed in row 2 of the table. CJUI-FM is actually a radio station owned by Vista Broadcast Group and is listed in row 10 of the table as "103.9 The Juice". Therefore, the statement "the call sign for Astral Media's radio station is CJUI-FM" is not supported by the information presented in the table.
2014	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "103.9 The Juice" is the radio station that plays adult hits. The owner of the radio station is listed as the "Vista Broadcast Group." Therefore, the statement "the owner of the radio station that plays adult hits is Bell Media" is refuted by the information presented in the table.
2015	The statement is not supported by the information in the table. The call sign for the radio owned by Bell Media is actually "CHSU-FM," which goes by the branding of "99.9 Sun FM" and is a contemporary hits radio format. The call sign "CKFR" belongs to a radio station owned by Astral Media, which goes by the branding of "AM 1150" and has a news/talk format.
2016	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Bell Media owns three radio stations in Kelowna: 99.9 Sun FM, 101.5 EZ Rock, and Q103. Similarly, the CBC also owns three radio stations in Kelowna: CBC Radio One, CBC Radio 2, and Première Chaîne. Therefore, the statement "bell media owns three separate radio stations like the CBC" is true and supported by the information in the table.
2017	Yes, the statement "there is more than one AM station" is supported by the table, as it shows that there is one AM station listed in the table (CKFR - AM 1150).
2018	Supported. Based on the information in the table, there is one classic rock station listed: K96.3, owned by Sun Country Cablevision. However, the table also shows that there are other stations with different formats, such as news/talk, public radio, contemporary hits radio, adult contemporary, hot adult contemporary, adult hits, and active rock. Therefore, the statement that "there is more than one classic rock station" is supported by the information presented in the table.
2019	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Bell Media owns three radio stations in Kelowna, which are:1. 99.9 Sun FM2. 101.5 EZ Rock3. Q103Similarly, the CBC also owns three radio stations in Kelowna, which are:1. CBC Radio One2. CBC Radio 23. Première ChaîneTherefore, both Bell Media and the CBC own three separate radio stations in Kelowna, which supports the given statement.
2020	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 4 of the table, the Uni-President Lions played against the Chinatrust Whales on March 22, 2007, and the Lions lost the game, with a score of 7-9. Kao Lung-Wei is listed as the pitcher for the Chinatrust Whales in that game.
2021	According to the table, Pan Wei-lun played against two teams: the LA New Bears and Chinatrust Whales, on March 17th and March 22nd respectively. On March 17th, the Uni-President Lions lost to the LA New Bears with a score of 4-5, with Pan Wei-lun listed as the losing pitcher. However, on March 22nd, the Uni-President Lions lost to the Chinatrust Whales with a score of 7-9, but the losing pitcher was Kao Lung-wei, not Pan Wei-lun. Therefore, the statement "Pan Wei-lun lost against Chinatrust Whales" is refuted by the table.
2022	Yes, the statement "Macoto Cobras is the opponent of Diegomar Markwell" is supported by the table. The table shows that on March 31, 2007, Uni-President Lions played against Macoto Cobras, and the Lions won 11-5. The last column of the table is blank for this game, but the second row of the table shows that the Lions used a player named Diegomar Markwell in the game, which implies that he was on the team that played against the Macoto Cobras. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
2023	Based on the information in the table, the statement is supported. Pan Wei-lun is listed as the loss in Row 5, with a save by Huang Chun-chung. The game was played against the Chinatrust Whales.
2024	The statement is refuted by the table. Horacio Estrada is actually listed as the winning pitcher in the game against the LA New Bears on March 18th, with a score of 4-1. Macoto Cobras is listed as the opponent on March 31st, with a score of 11-5, but there is no mention of Horacio Estrada or any loss in that game. Therefore, the statement "macoto cobras is the opponent when Horacio Estrada is the loss" is not supported by the information in the table.
