4	Supported. Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode in series 2 of "Merlin" which was "Sweet Dreams" (no. 10).
5	There is no information in the table about the viewership of "Beauty and the Beast" parts 1 and 2, therefore the statement cannot be verified or refuted using this table.

9	Supported. According to the table, Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode in series 2, which is titled "Sweet Dreams".
10	The statement is not related to the information provided in the table.
11	The statement is not supported by the table as it does not provide information on the number of goals scored by each player.
12	The statement is not directly supported or refuted by the information provided in the table as it does not explicitly show the number of goals scored by Jonathan Legear and Matias Suarez in the Belgian Cup.
13	Supported. Jonathan Legear scored 5 goals in the league and 2 goals in the title playoff for a total of 7 goals, while the other three players (Boussoufa, De Sutter, Gillet) scored a total of 20 goals. Therefore, Legear scored more goals than the other players combined. However, it should be noted that the statement only refers to the Belgian Cup, and the table does not provide information on how many goals were scored by each player in that competition.
14	Refuted. While Guillaume Gillet had the highest number of goals in the league with 8, he did not score three times as much as each of the other two players (Mbark Boussoufa and Tom De Sutter) as they only scored 11 and 9 goals respectively, which is not three times less than 8.
15	Supported. Matias Suarez, the top scorer, has 3 goals while Mbark Boussoufa has 11 goals, which is 8 more than Suarez.
16	The statement is not directly supported by the information provided in the table. While it is possible that the four players who scored three goals total are in league 5, this cannot be confirmed as the table only displays the number of goals scored by each player in different competitions and not their league division.
17	The statement is unsupported by the information provided in the table since there is no data on the number of goals scored by Matias Suarez in the Belgian Cup.
18	The statement is supported. Lucas Biglia scored 3 goals in the 2008-09 season, while the other three players who played in the Belgian Cup (Matías Suárez, Oleksandr Iakovenko, and Hernán Losada) did not score any, thus meaning that he scored more goals than the other players combined.
19	Refuted. The table shows that Jelle Van Damme only scored 3 goals, which is the same as other players such as Matías Suárez and Dmitri Bulykin. Therefore, he did not score three times as much as each of the other two players as stated in the statement.
20	The statement is supported by the table as it confirms that Matias Suarez has 3 goals while Bart Goor has 1 goal in the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season.
21	Supported.

28	The statement is not supported or refuted as the table does not provide enough information about the scores of players from Japan specifically.
29	The statement is refuted. There are only four countries represented by the players: United States, Wales, Japan, and Spain.
30	Supported. The table shows that Ian Woosnam from Wales won 67,823 dollars, which is the same amount as the other two players who tied for second place in the 1989 U.S. Open golf tournament. Therefore, the most amount of money won by someone from Wales in that tournament was indeed 46,823 dollars.
31	The statement is not supported by the information provided in the table as only Slovakia is listed as a non-North American country.
32	The statement is supported by the table, as there are five players from both the United States and Canada on the Philadelphia Flyers team in the 2004-05 season.
33	The statement is supported by the information provided in the table.

35	The statement is supported by the table as Triston Grant is the only player listed for left wing.

39	The statement is supported.
40	Supported. Triston Grant plays the same position as the other player drafted in his round, and that player is John Carter, a center.

46	The statement is refuted. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy beer won awards in 2002 and 2005, among other years.
47	The statement is partially supported. While it is true that Dr Hexter's Healer beer only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009, the table shows that the same beer won a gold medal in 2008 and 2009 at the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival and a gold medal in 2009 at the CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition. Therefore, the statement should be revised to say that Dr Hexter's Healer beer only received a silver medal in competitions between 1995 and 2007.
48	Supported. From 1995 to 2009, the beer "Maggs Magnificent Mild" won a gold medal every time it won a prize. This is shown in rows 6, 9, 12, 14, and 26 of the table.

73	The statement is not supported or refuted by the information provided in the table, as there is no information about the gap between the first and last place.
74	The statement is unsupported by the information provided in the table as there is no mention of "partice macrez" in the top three rankings of the competition where Mark Cockerell appears to have finished first with 172.42 points.

85	The statement is not supported or refuted by the information provided in the table as it does not specifically indicate the highest home team score.

184	Supported. The table shows that ngc 1796 has a redshift of 1014 km/s, which is lower than ngc 1705 with a redshift of 633 km/s. Therefore, ngc 1705 has the largest redshift in the Dorado Group.
185	Supported. The table shows that ngc 1705 has a redshift of 633 km/s, while ngc 2082 has a redshift of 1184 km/s. The difference between the two, 551 km/s, is greater than the stated difference in the statement (441 km/s), suggesting that ngc 1705 is indeed redshifted faster than ngc 2082.

1413	The statement is not supported by the information in the table as the playing surface mentioned in the statement is "hard" and the closest match listed in the table with a hard surface was played in Tokyo, Japan on October 10, 2004 against Taylor Dent. However, the statement mentions Auckland, New Zealand as the location. Therefore, the information in the table does not support or refute the statement.

1435	The statement is partially supported by the information provided in the table. The table shows that in the period of 1965-1970, there were 3,330,000 live births per year and 998,000 deaths per year, which is close to the numbers provided in the statement. However, the table does not provide information on the natural change per year, cbr, cdr, nc, tfr, imr, and life expectancy total, so it is impossible to fully verify the statement using the table alone.

1440	Supported. The table shows that in the period of 1990-1995, there were 1,058,000 deaths per year and the crude death rate (cdr) was 6.8. Therefore, in the period where there were 1,086,000 deaths per year, the cdr is likely to be around 6.5, which falls within the range provided in the table.
1441	The statement is not directly supported or refuted by the information provided in the table as there is no specific column or data point for "natural changes."
