1	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, "The Witchfinder" episode (episode 7) aired on November 7th, 2009, and "Sweet Dreams" (episode 10) aired on November 28th, 2009, meaning that "The Witchfinder" episode occurred earlier in the series than "Sweet Dreams".
2	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that David Moore directed the following episodes of Merlin Series 2: - The Curse of Cornelius Sigan - Lancelot and Guinevere- Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)
3	Supported. According to the provided table, "The Lady of the Lake" episode had 6.3 million UK viewers, which is the highest number of viewers compared to the other episodes in series 2 of Merlin.
4	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Lucy Watkins only wrote one episode, which is "Sweet Dreams". All the other episodes were written by different writers.
5	The statement is supported by the table. Beauty and the Beast (Part 1) had 5.53 million UK viewers, while Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) had 6.14 million UK viewers, which is a higher number.
6	The statement is refuted by the table. The "Sweet Dreams" episode (Episode 10) aired after "The Witchfinder" episode (Episode 7) in series 2 of Merlin, according to the table.
7	The statement is not fully supported by the table. David Moore directed three episodes (episodes 1, 4, and 5) of series 2 of Merlin, not five.
8	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, "The Lady of the Lake" episode had the fourth-highest viewership in the series, with 6.3 million viewers. Therefore, the statement that this episode had the least UK viewers is incorrect.
9	The statement is supported by the table as there is no entry for Lucy Watkins as a writer for any of the 12 episodes in series 2.
10	The statement is refuted by the table. "Beauty and the Beast (part 2)" had more UK viewers (6.14 million) compared to "Beauty and the Beast (part 1)" (5.53 million).
11	I'm sorry, the table you provided does not have a column indicating the league in which the goals were scored. Therefore, it is not possible to verify whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
12	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Matías Suárez scored three goals (one in the league and two in the Belgian Cup) while Jonathan Legear scored seven goals (five in the league, one in the title playoffs, and one in the Super Cup) during the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season. Therefore, Jonathan Legear scored three more goals than Matías Suárez, not four.
13	The provided table does not contain information on the Belgian Cup specifically, so it cannot be used to verify or refute the stated claim.
14	I'm sorry, but the provided table does not contain any information about the UEFA Champions League tournament. It only shows the number of goals scored by each player for R.S.C. Anderlecht in the league, title playoff, and super cup matches during the 2008-2009 season. Therefore, I cannot verify the statement based on the table provided.
15	The statement cannot be fully verified or refuted based on the given table alone. The table only provides information on the number of league goals, title playoff goals, super cup goals, and total goals for each player on R.S.C. Anderlecht during the 2008-09 season. It does not provide information on the top scorers in the Belgian First Division A for that season or how many goals they scored. Therefore, additional information would be needed to verify or refute the statement.
16	I'm sorry, the statement cannot be verified using the provided table as there is no information on the total number of goals scored by each player throughout the season. The table only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, and super cup separately. Therefore, we cannot confirm if four players scored three goals total or if all four players are in league 5.
17	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, and super cup matches, but not in the Belgian Cup. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Thomas Chatelle scored more goals than Matias Suarez in the Belgian Cup based on the provided table.
18	I'm sorry, the table does not provide information regarding the Belgian Cup or how many goals each player scored in that competition. Therefore, I cannot confirm or refute the statement using this table.
19	I'm sorry, the provided table does not contain information regarding goals scored in the UEFA Champions League tournament. The table only provides information on the number of goals scored by each player in the Belgian league, playoffs, and super cup during the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the statement using this table.
20	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the top scorer for the team during the 2008-09 season was Mbark Boussoufa, who scored a total of 11 goals. Bart Goor only scored 1 goal according to the table. Additionally, the table only provides information about the number of goals scored by players for R.S.C. Anderlecht and does not provide data on other players in the Belgian first division, which cannot be verified using this table. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed or denied using the provided table.
21	The statement is supported by the table. In the 1989 U.S. Open (golf), four players tied for ninth place and three of those players were from the United States: Paul Azinger, Hubert Green, and Tom Kite.
22	The statement is supported by the table. Out of the players who scored under par, which means they had a negative number in the "to par" column, the majority (4 out of 5) are from the United States. Curtis Strange, Chip Beck, Mark McCumber, and Ian Woosnam all had a score of -2, -1, -1, and -1 respectively, and they are all from the United States or Wales. Only one player who scored under par, Brian Claar, is not from the United States.
23	The statement is supported by the table. Masashi Ozaki, the only player from Japan, scored 281.
24	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as it does not have a column indicating the player's country directly. However, we can infer that there are at least three countries represented by the players: the United States, Wales, and Japan. It is possible that there may be players from other countries, but this information is not available in the table.
25	Supported. The table shows that Ian Woosnam from Wales won $67,823, which was tied for second place with two other players. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
26	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at row 6, Brian Claar from the United States finished in fifth place, and rows 7 and 8 are both tied for sixth place with 281. Therefore, the statement is technically correct as three people are tied for fifth place or better and they are all from the United States.
27	The statement is unsupported by the table. Out of the 13 golfers listed in the table, only 5 players scored over par, and from that group, 3 players are from the United States, and 2 are from other countries (Japan and Spain). Therefore, the majority of players who scored over par are not from the United States.
28	The statement is refuted by the table as there is only one player from Japan listed in the table (Masashi Ozaki) and his score is 281, which is not close to an average score of 251.
29	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as it only lists the countries of the players and not the total number of countries represented.
30	The statement is refuted by the table. The player from Wales, Ian Woosnam, earned $67,823, which is less than the stated amount. Therefore, the statement is false.
31	The statement appears to be supported by the table. All of the players listed in the table, except for Ladislav Scurko from Slovakia, have either the United States or Canada listed as their nationality.
32	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, I can see that there are exactly five players from the United States and five players from Canada, fulfilling the statement's claim.
33	The statement is supported by the table as every player listed attended a different college, junior or club team within their respective league.
34	The statement is supported by the table. Only the player selections in round 3 of the 2004-05 Philadelphia Flyers season are listed once, while selections in rounds 4 to 9 are listed twice as they had two picks in those rounds.
35	Supported. According to the provided table, Triston Grant is listed as the only player for the left wing position.
36	The table provided does not contain any information about a player from Norway, therefore the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
37	Supported. From the table, we can see there are a total of 11 players listed with their position, nationality, and college/junior/club team. Out of these 11 players, 7 are from Canada, while only 4 are from the United States. Therefore, the number of players from Canada outnumbers the number of players from the United States.
38	The statement is supported by the table. Every player in the table is listed with their college/junior/club team, indicating that all players on the 2004-05 Philadelphia Flyers roster either came from a college program or a junior/club team.
39	The statement is supported by the table. From rows 1 to 12, there are two players listed in each of the rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Therefore, it can be confirmed that two players were drafted in each of these rounds by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2004-05 season.
40	The statement cannot be verified by the given table as it only provides information about the players that were drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2004-05 season, including their round, position, nationality, and team played for at that time. However, it does not provide any information about the position of the other player drafted in the same round as Triston Grant.
41	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the "Good Old Boy" beer from the West Berkshire Brewery received awards in five different years between 1995 and 2009, including an overall winner and gold medals in different categories and competitions.
42	The statement is partially supported by the table. West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer beer won a gold medal in 1997 at the CAMRA Northamptonshire Branch Beer Festival, a gold medal in 2008 at the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival, and a gold medal in 2009 at the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival and the CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition. Therefore, Dr Hexter's Healer beer won a total of three gold medals, but between 1997 and 2009, not 1995 and 2009 as stated in the statement.
43	Supported. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won several awards in various competitions from 2002 to 2009, including two gold medals in the SIBA South East Region beer competition for mild and porter in 2002 and 2005, respectively, as well as a gold medal for mild in the CAMRA Reading Branch beer festival in 2005. The beer also won the overall prize for Beer of the Festival in the Bracknell Blues and Real Ale Festival in 2004. Therefore, the statement that "West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild was its most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009" is supported by the table.
44	The statement is unsupported by the table. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery won awards for multiple beers between 1995 and 2009. There are at least six different beers that won awards during this period, with Good Old Boy and Maggs Magnificent Mild winning multiple awards each.
45	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal in the Mild and Porter category at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005. The beer also won a gold medal in the Mild and Porter category at the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2003. Therefore, the statement is true.
46	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's "Good Old Boy" beer has won multiple awards, including Overall Winner at the CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival in 1995, Gold Medal for Best Bitter at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002, and a Silver Medal for Best Bitter at the same competition in 2005. Additionally, the beer has won awards at other competitions such as the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival and the Norwich Beer Festival. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is false.
47	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery's "Dr Hexter's Healer" beer has won multiple prizes and awards including a runner-up award in the "Beer of the Festival" category at the 1997 CAMRA Northamptonshire Branch Beer Festival, a silver medal in the "Strong Ale" category at the 2002 SIBA South East Region Beer Competition, and a gold medal in both the "Best Local Beer" category at the 2008 and 2009 CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival, and the "In Category" category at the 2009 CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition. Therefore, the statement that "West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer beer has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009" is false.
48	Supported. The table shows that West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal every time it received a prize between 1995 and 2009, as it won gold medals for Mild and Porter at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005, as well as a gold medal for Mild at the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival in 2005, the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2006, and the CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival in 2006.
49	The statement is partly supported by the table. According to row 6 and 15 in the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild received a gold medal in the Mild and Porter category at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005. However, the table does not mention any bronze award for the same beer during the mentioned period in the SIBA National Beer Competition.
50	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 2, 3, and 7 all have the same attendance of 18,422.
51	Supported. The highest attendance listed in the table is for game 77 on April 5th against Dallas, which was played at the American Airlines Center with an attendance of 20,301.
52	The statement cannot be verified or refuted by the provided table. While the table includes the dates and locations of various games played by the Phoenix Suns, it does not explicitly state the chronological order of those games beyond a single game's placement in relation to the others. To determine whether the game at the Target Center took place after the game at the FedExForum, one would need to access additional information such as the schedule for the entire NBA season during that year.
53	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the game against New Orleans on April 8 had an attendance of 17,781, while the game against Minnesota on April 11 had an attendance of 18,478, which means that the game against Minnesota had a higher attendance than the game against New Orleans. Therefore, the statement is false.
54	The statement is supported by the table. The game against New Orleans on April 8 had an attendance of 17,781, whereas the game against Dallas on April 5 had an attendance of 20,301. Therefore, the game against Dallas had the highest attendance.
55	The statement is not supported by the table. The attendance for Golden State (the last game) is not listed, and the attendance for Memphis and New Orleans are different, 15908 and 17781 respectively. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that they all had the same attendance.
56	The statement is refuted by the table as the attendance for the game held at Target Center (row 7) was 18,478, while the attendance for the game held at American Airlines Center (row 4) was 20,301, which is higher. Therefore, the highest attendance was not at the Target Center but at the American Airlines Center.
57	Refuted. The game at the Target Center in Minnesota took place on April 11 (row 6) and the game at the FedExForum in Memphis took place on April 8 (row 5). Therefore, the game at the FedExForum took place before the game at the Target Center.
58	The statement is refuted by the provided table. The game against Minnesota had an attendance of 18478, which is higher than the attendance of the game against New Orleans, which had an attendance of 17781. Therefore, the statement is false.
59	The statement is refuted by the table. The game against Dallas had the highest attendance with 20,301 people. The game against New Orleans had an attendance of 17,781.
60	The statement is supported by the table. Emi Watanabe of Japan was ranked third with a total of 180.52 points and Dagmar Lurz of West Germany was ranked fourth with a total of 179.96 points in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships.
61	The statement is supported by the table as the highest score is 186.92 and the lowest score is 112.28. The difference between the two scores is 74.64, as stated in the statement.
62	The statement is supported by the table. Linda Fratianne from the United States is ranked first with a score of 186.92 and Anett Pötzsch from East Germany is ranked second with a score of 184.36.
63	The statement is supported by the provided table. Bodil Olsson is listed as being from Sweden and received a score of 23 for her SP+FS, not 27 as stated in the statement.
64	The table does not provide information on which female skater lost the championship, so it cannot be determined whether Natalia Strelkova won or lost. Therefore, the table neither supports nor refutes the statement.
65	The statement is supported by the table as "Emi Watanabe" is ranked third with a total of 180.52 points and "Dagmar Lurz" is ranked fourth with a total of 179.96 points. Thus, Emi Watanabe is two places higher than Dagmar Lurz.
66	The statement is incorrect. The score difference between the highest score (186.92 earned by Linda Fratianne from the United States) and the lowest score (112.28 earned by Gloria Mas from Spain) is actually 74.64 points, not 64.64 points.
67	The statement is supported by the table. Linda Fratianne finished in first place with a total score of 186.92 and Anett Pötzsch finished in second place with a total score of 184.36, but did not manage to get in the top 3.
68	The statement is incorrect. Natalia Strelkova is listed as finishing in 13th place with 164.94 points. Gloria Mas of Spain finished in last place with 112.28 points.
69	Supported. According to the table, Mark Cockerell has a score of 172.42 and placed 1st while Patrice Macrez has a score of 151.76 and placed 7th, indicating that Mark Cockerell had a better score than Patrice Macrez.
70	The statement is supported by the table. West Germany has two skaters who placed in the top six, Norbert Schramm and Stephan Brill, but neither won a medal. Mark Cockerell from the United States won the gold, Takashi Mura from Japan won the silver, and Brian Pockar from Canada won the bronze medal.
71	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Pierre Lamine of France has scored 150.5 points and placed 8th, whereas Shinji Someya of Japan has scored 150.34 points and placed 9th in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Therefore, Lamine has a mere 0.16 points more than Someya.
72	The statement is supported by the table. France's competitors Patrice Macrez and Pierre Lamine finished in the consecutive positions of 7th and 8th respectively, with scores of 151.76 and 150.5.
73	The statement is supported by the table. The scores of the first and the last rank in the table are 172.42 and 114.38, respectively. Subtracting the score of the last rank from that of the first rank yields a difference of 58.04 (172.42 - 114.38 = 58.04), which confirms that the gap between first and last was a total of 58.04.
74	This statement is refuted by the table. Mark Cockerell finished with a score of 172.42 and a rank of 1, while Patrice Macrez finished with a score of 151.76 and a rank of 7. Therefore, Mark Cockerell had a much better score than Patrice Macrez.
75	The statement is supported by the table. West Germany had Norbert Schramm in fourth place and Stephan Bril in sixth place, giving them two of the top six positions. Mark Cockerell from the United States won the gold medal with a total score of 172.42 points.
76	The statement is supported by the table. Pierre Lamine scored 150.5 points and placed 8th, while Shinji Someya scored 150.34 points and placed 9th, indicating that Pierre Lamine beat Shinji Someya by 0.16 points (more than one point).
77	The statement is refuted by the table as Patrice Macrez from France finished 7th (6th in short program and 8th in free skating), while Pierre Lamine from France finished 8th (8th in short program and 7th in free skating) in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships.
78	The statement is supported by the table. The difference in points between the first-place skater (Mark Cockerell) and the last-place skater (Marc Franquet) is 58.04 points, which is more than 50.
79	The given table does not support the statement as it does not show any match played by the Detroit Red Wings as a visitor. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the Detroit Red Wings had the highest visitor score with 5 points with the information provided.
80	The statement is supported by the table. On January 5th, 2004, Detroit played against Nashville and won 6-0 as the home team. This is the highest home team score in the table provided.
81	Supported. According to the table, Detroit scored the highest of the season on January 5th with 6 points against Nashville.
82	The table shows that the attendance was indeed 20066 on six dates: January 3, January 5, January 7, January 14, January 16, and January 29. Therefore, the statement that the highest attendance was 20066 on six dates is supported by the table.
83	The statement is supported by the table. On January 5, Detroit won against Nashville with a score of 6-0, which gave them a gap of 6 points in the records column (26-12-4-1 before the game and 27-12-4-1 after the game).
84	The table does not provide information on the scores of other teams in the league during the 2003-04 season. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether Detroit had one of the lowest visitor scores for the season. The table only shows the scores for Detroit and their opponents in the games they played, not the scores of all other teams.
85	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only lists the scores for each game played by the Detroit Red Wings during the given timeframe. The table does not compare the scores of different teams or identify which team had the highest home score.
86	The statement cannot be supported nor refuted by the provided table. The table only includes information about the results of Detroit Red Wings' games in January 2004 and does not provide information about other NHL teams' scoring performance during the same period. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether or not Detroit was the lowest scoring team at that time based solely on the provided table.
87	The statement is supported by the table. The attendance rate of 20,066 occurred in 6 of the 14 games listed in the table.
88	The provided table does not contain information regarding the point gap between teams, but rather displays the dates, opponents, scores, goaltending decisions, attendance, and record of the Detroit Red Wings during the 2003-04 season. Therefore, the table cannot support or refute the statement about the point gap.
89	The statement is refuted by the table as the term start for Bashkim Fino is listed as March 11, 1997, which is before the term start for Vilson Ahmeti on December 10, 1991.
90	The statement is supported by the table. - Ilir Meta served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 1999-2002 and was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. - Bashkim Fino served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 1997-1998 and was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. - Ylli Bufi served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 1991-1992 and was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. - Pandeli Majko served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 1998-1999 and was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.
91	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term ended on December 10, 1991, while Vilson Ahmeti's term ended on April 13, 1992. Therefore, the term end for Vilson Ahmeti was after the term end for Ylli Bufi.
92	The statement is supported by the table, as it shows that Sali Berisha was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania and served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 11 September 2005 to 15 September 2013. The table also shows that Aleksandër Meksi, who was a Prime Minister of Albania from 1992 to 1997, was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.
93	Supported. Fatos Nano was a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and was elected as Prime Minister of Albania during his first term (row 3 of the table). No other Prime Minister in the provided table was a member of this political party.
94	The statement is supported by the table. Ylli Bufi's term started on June 5, 1991, while Vilson Ahmeti's term started on December 10, 1991, which is after Ylli Bufi's term start.
95	The statement is refuted by the table. None of these prime ministers listed in the table were members of the Democratic Party of Albania. Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were all members of the Socialist Party of Albania.
96	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term ended on December 10, 1991, whereas Aleksandër Meksi's term ended on March 11, 1997. Therefore, the term end for Aleksandër Meksi was after the term end for Ylli Bufi.
97	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table. The table only includes information about the term start and term end dates, political parties, and birth and death years (where applicable) of each prime minister of Albania from 1991 onwards. The table does not provide information about when each prime minister was elected as a member of a specific political party, so it is not possible to verify the statement using this table alone.
98	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there have been multiple prime ministers who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania, including Fatos Nano (1st time), Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano (2nd time), Pandeli Majko (1st time), Ilir Meta, Pandeli Majko (2nd time), and Edi Rama.
99	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1987-88, whereas Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1979-80. Therefore, their time on the team did not overlap.
100	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz only in 1979-80, while Darryl Dawkins played for the team in 1987-88, which means Darryl played for the Jazz after Paul by almost a decade. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
101	The statement is refuted by the table as Adrian Dantley was on the team from 1979-1986 while Brad Davis was on the team only in 1979-1980. Therefore, they were not on the team together for the entire time.
102	Supported. According to the table, James Donaldson is listed in row 7 as a center who played for the Utah Jazz in 1993, as well as in 1994-95, indicating that he had two different stints with the team.
103	The statement is supported by the table. The table includes the names of four players who played for the Utah Jazz in 1979-80: Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, Greg Deane, and John Duren. All four players are listed as guards. Therefore, the Jazz had at least three guards on the team in 1979-80, and the statement is true.
104	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows two players with the last name Dawkins, but their years for the Jazz did not overlap. Darryl Dawkins played for the team in 1987-88 as a center, while Paul Dawkins played for the team in 1979-80 as a guard.
105	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Darryl Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz for only one year (1987-88) and Paul Dawkins played for the team for one year in 1979-80. Therefore, Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz six years after Paul Dawkins.
106	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as Brad Davis played for the Utah Jazz for only one year and Adrian Dantley played for the team for seven years. Therefore, while both players were on the team at the same time, Dantley was on the team before, during, and after Davis's one year with the team.
107	Supported. According to the provided table, James Donaldson had two separate years where he played for the Utah Jazz. These years were 1993 and 1994-95. Thus, James Donaldson had a total of five years playing for the Utah Jazz.
108	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows only two guards on the All-Time Roster of the Utah Jazz who played for the team in 1979-80: Brad Davis and Paul Dawkins. James Donaldson is listed as a center who played for the team in 1993, 1994-95.
109	The statement is refuted by the table. The Open Championship is listed in the table with 7 events, while the PGA Championship has been played in 6 events. Therefore, the PGA Championship has the highest number of events in the table.
110	The statement is supported by the table. The "wins" column shows that Brian Watts had 0 wins in all four tournaments (Masters, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship) and the "totals" row confirms that his total number of wins in those tournaments is 0. Therefore, the statement "none of the tournaments resulted in a win for Brian Watts" is true.
111	Refuted. According to the table, the PGA Championship had 4 cuts made and the US Open had 1 cut made. Therefore, the PGA Championship had one more cut made than the US Open, not three more as stated.
112	The statement that "all the tournaments listed had an average of 2.5 events" is refuted by the provided table. We can see that the tournaments listed in the table have varying numbers of events, ranging from two events to seven events. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that all the tournaments listed had an average of 2.5 events.
113	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, Brian Watts did not earn any top-25 finishes at the Masters Tournament, as the corresponding value in the "Top-25" column is 0.
114	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Brian Watts has participated in 7 Open Championships, which is his highest number of events in any tournament listed.
115	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, Brian Watts did not win any major tournament. The "wins" column in the table shows "0" for all four major tournaments (Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship).
116	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the given table. Although the table provides data on the number of cuts made by Brian Watts in the US Open and the PGA Championship, it does not provide enough information to compare the two.Furthermore, the table shows that Brian Watts had 4 cuts made in both events and not "three fewer cuts made in the PGA Championship compared to the US Open". Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
117	The statement "Brian Watts not in the top 25 at the Masters Tournament one time" is supported by the table. In row 2, it can be seen that Brian Watts did not have a top-25 finish at the Masters Tournament, as the value for "top-25" is 0.
118	According to the table, the statement is partially supported. Only 5 viral families, namely Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, have a replication site in the nucleus. Therefore, the statement that "9 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus" is not entirely true.
119	Supported. The table shows that 14 viral families have a replication site in the cytoplasm: Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Unassigned.
120	Supported. The statement is true as per the provided table - the families Herpesviridae and Poxviridae have a complex virion shape.
121	The statement is supported by the table. 13 of the 24 viral families listed in the table have an icosahedral virion shape: adenoviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae, astroviridae, caliciviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviridae, flaviviridae, togaviridae, hepeviridae, and reoviridae.
122	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, there are seven viral families that have a helical virion shape. These viral families are: Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae.
123	Based on the table given, the statement "nine of the viral diseases replicate in the nucleus" is partially supported as only five of the viruses listed in the table replicate in the nucleus: Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae.
124	According to the table provided, the unassigned family in Group V has an enveloped virion shape that is spherical. Therefore, the statement "only one of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape" is refuted by the table.
125	The statement is supported by the table. Out of the 23 virus families listed in the table, 8 virus families are classified as non-enveloped (Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae).
126	The statement "only one of the viral diseases is in the Baltimore Group III" is supported by the table. The only virus in the table belonging to Baltimore Group III is Reoviridae.
127	The statement is supported by the table. The table includes a row labeled "unassigned" in which the family, baltimore group, envelopment, virion shape, and replication site are not specified. This implies that there is at least one viral disease that has not been assigned to a family.
128	The statement that "9 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm" is supported by the provided table. The families that have cytoplasm as their replication site are Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae. These families are represented in rows 9 to 19 in the table.
129	The statement is refuted by the provided table. Only 4 out of 23 families (Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Retroviridae) have a replication site in the nucleus.
130	The statement is supported by the table. The families Orthomyxoviridae and Arenaviridae in row 17 and 18 respectively have a helical virion shape based on the "virion shape" column in the provided table.
131	The provided table provides evidence that the statement "thirteen viral families have a helical virion shape" is partially supported. Eleven viral families out of the 23 assigned families listed in the table have an enveloped virion shape that is helical (Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and a yet-to-be-assigned family with a spherical enveloped virion shape as well as coronaviruses, retroviruses, and one yet-to-be-assigned family with a complex enveloped virion shape). Two non-enveloped viral families (Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae) out of the six non-enveloped viral families in total have an icosahedral virion shape. Therefore, the statement is not entirely supported by the provided table.
132	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, 7 viral families, namely Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, and Picornaviridae, have an icosahedral virion shape.
133	The statement is partially supported by the table. Only six of the viral families listed in the table replicate outside the nucleus: Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae while the replication site of the remaining viral families is either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Therefore, the statement that nine of the viral diseases replicate outside the nucleus is incorrect.
134	The provided table refutes the statement "none of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape". Row 23 in the table shows "unassigned" with an "enveloped, spherical" virion shape. Therefore, there is at least one viral disease with a spherical virion shape, and the statement is refuted by the table.
135	The statement is supported by the table. Eight out of the twenty-three viruses listed in the table have an enveloped virion (Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Retroviridae).
136	There is no information shown in the provided table about viral diseases or any specific viral disease belonging to Baltimore group iii. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
137	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table. The table lists various families of viruses and their characteristics, but it does not provide information on which viral diseases have been assigned to a specific family. Furthermore, there are numerous viral diseases caused by different types of viruses, and not all viral diseases have been classified or assigned to a family.
138	The statement is refuted by the table provided. While Galina Voskoboeva did play multiple matches on hard surfaces, the specific number of games played on hard surfaces cannot be determined from the table alone.
139	I'm sorry, but the table provided only accounts for five (5) of Galina Voskoboeva's tennis matches and there is no information in the table on the total number of games she played or the types of courts she played on. Therefore, it is not possible to support or refute the statement using the table provided.
140	The table provided only includes the tournament date, outcome, opponent, score, tournament, and surface. It does not show a comprehensive list of all the matches played by Galina Voskoboeva on different surfaces. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if the statement "galina voskoboeva has an equal winrate between both clay and hard courts" is supported or refuted by the table.
141	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only shows the opponents and scores of a few matches played by Galina Voskoboeva but does not indicate whether any of those opponents were played more than once. Therefore, additional information is required to verify the given statement.
142	Sorry, the table provided does not contain enough information to verify the given statement. It only provides the outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score for a few matches played by Galina Voskoboeva. It does not contain data on the average points she loses in each match.
143	The statement is refuted by the table as Galina Voskoboeva played 2 games on hard and 2 games on clay.
144	Unfortunately, the provided table does not contain enough information to verify the statement that "galina voskoboeva played 20% of her games on a clay top tennis court and 1% on hard". The table only shows a few matches and surfaces played on, which cannot be used to determine the overall percentage of matches played on each surface by Galina Voskoboeva throughout her career.
145	The provided table does not contain enough information to verify the statement regarding Galina Voskoboeva's win rate on clay and hard courts. The table only shows the outcomes of five specific matches she played in 2003, 2005 and 2006, and does not give a comprehensive overview of her career record on different surfaces. Additionally, the table shows that she did in fact win at least one tournament on hard courts in June 2003. Therefore, we cannot necessarily support or refute the given statement about her win rate.
146	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Galina Voskoboeva played different opponents in each of her matches except on June 6, 2006, where she played Alice Canepa and won the match.
147	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table because it only includes the final score of the matches and not the total number of points won by each player. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the average number of points lost by Galina Voskoboeva against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa using the information from the table.
148	The statement is supported by the table. Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 of the 24 stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, according to the table.
149	The statement is supported by the table. Alfredo Binda won six races of the 1933 Giro d'Italia (May 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 22) and was the race leader for 13 races (May 7-8, 10-12, 17-22, and 24).
150	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Gerard Loncke from Belgium won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano on May 26th, 1933, despite Alfredo Binda from Italy being the race leader at the time. However, it should be noted that this statement only refers to a single stage of the race, and not the overall winner. Alfredo Binda won the 1933 Giro d'Italia, while Loncke finished fifth in the general classification.
151	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ettore Meini won two consecutive stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia. He won the stage from Ferrara to Udine on May 24th and the stage from Udine to Bassano del Grappa on May 25th.
152	Supported. According to the table, Learco Guerra was the race leader after the first stage of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, but Alfredo Binda took over as race leader and held on to that position for the rest of the circuit.
153	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for a total of 15 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia. He took the leader's jersey on the second stage and held on to it until the end of the race.
154	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Alfredo Binda won seven races out of the 25 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia. Additionally, he was the race leader for a total of 15 races, which is consistent with the statement.
155	The statement is supported by the table. On May 25th in the 1933 Giro d'Italia, Gerard Loncke (Bel) won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano, and despite that, Alfredo Binda (Ita) remained the race leader.
156	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Ettore Meini won the stage from Ferrara to Udine on May 24th, the stage from Udine to Bassano del Grappa on May 25th, and the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano on May 26th, all during the 1933 Giro d'Italia. Therefore, Ettore Meini did win three races in a row during the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
157	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Learco Guerra won the first stage and became the race leader, but he did not become the race leader again for the rest of the circuit. After the second stage, Alfredo Binda became the race leader and held onto that position for the remainder of the race.
158	The statement is supported by the table. We can see from the table that two players, Ray Donaldson and Tim Foley, were picked during the 2nd round of the draft.
159	The statement is supported by the table. Wes Roberts was picked by the Indianapolis Colts in the 7th round with the 170th overall pick (Row 8), and Ed Whitley was chosen in the 11th round with the 280th overall pick (Row 12). Therefore, Wes Roberts was picked before Ed Whitley.
160	Supported. There are two players from USC (wide receiver Ray Butler and center Chris Foote) and one player from Clemson (fullback Marvin Sims) in the provided table. Thus, more players were drafted from USC than from Clemson.
161	The provided table does not support or refute the statement about no players in the running back position being picked after the 10th round. The table only provides information on the Indianapolis Colts' draft history for a specific year or draft class and the positions and colleges of each pick. Without additional information about the draft years included in the table or the entirety of the Colts' draft history, it cannot be determined whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
162	Supported. Curtis Dickey was picked in Round 1, with the 5th overall pick, while Randy Bielski was picked in Round 12, with the 6th and 19th overall picks. Therefore, Curtis Dickey was picked much earlier in the draft than Randy Bielski.
163	The statement is supported by the table, as there were indeed 5 players picked in the 2nd round, including Ray Donaldson, Tim Foley, Chris Foote, Ken Walter, and Larry Stewart.
164	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Wes Roberts was picked in the 7th round with the 170th overall pick, and Ed Whitley was picked in the 11th round with the 280th overall pick.
165	Refuted. The provided table only includes 1 player each from USC and Clemson. Therefore, the statement that "USC and Clemson had the most players drafted at 3 each" is not supported by the table provided.
166	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there was only one running back picked (Curtis Dickey) and he was picked in the first round, not in the sixth round.
167	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Curtis Dickey was picked in Round 1 with the 5th overall pick, and Randy Bielski was picked in Round 12 with the 6th pick.
168	The statement is supported by the table. Italy won two gold medals, the same as the United States and West Germany. However, Italy's total medal count of 5 was higher than Canada's total medal count of 2, with no gold medals.
169	The statement is supported by the table. Sweden won a total of six medals (four gold, zero silver, and two bronze) and placed fifth overall. Austria won a total of ten medals (three gold, five silver, and two bronze) and placed sixth overall. Therefore, Sweden did place higher than Austria in the total medal count for the 1988 Olympics.
170	The statement is supported by the table as six different countries (Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, West Germany, and the United States) all received 2 bronze medals each, as listed in the "Bronze" column of the table.
171	The statement is refuted by the table. Sweden received 4 gold, 0 silver, and 2 bronze medals, for a total of 6 medals overall. Canada received 0 gold, 2 silver, and 3 bronze medals, for a total of 5 medals overall. Therefore, they both received medals across the categories.
172	The statement is supported by the table. The Soviet Union won 29 medals in total, whereas East Germany won 25 medals in total. Therefore, the Soviet Union received four more medals than East Germany in the total medal count.
173	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Italy received two gold medals, while Canada did not receive any gold medals at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The table also shows that Italy did not tie with the United States and West Germany in terms of total medals won, as Italy won a total of 5 medals, while the United States won 6 medals and West Germany won 8 medals.
174	The statement is refuted by the table. Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze) and Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze), placing Sweden higher than Austria in the total medal count for the 1988 Olympics.
175	The statement is supported by the provided table for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Looking at the "Bronze" column in the table, it can be seen that eight countries (Soviet Union, East Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, Netherlands, West Germany, and United States) received three bronze medals each.
176	The statement is true. Sweden did not receive a medal in the silver category (0 silver medals) and Canada did not receive a medal in the gold category (0 gold medals). All of the other countries on the table received medals in at least two of the categories (gold, silver, or bronze).
177	The statement is refuted by the table. The Soviet Union received 29 medals in total (11 gold, 9 silver, and 9 bronze) while East Germany received 25 medals in total (9 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, the Soviet Union received 4 more medals than East Germany in the total medal count, not 6.
178	Supported. From the table, we can see that the apparent magnitude of ngc 1796 is 12.9 and the apparent magnitude of ngc 1705 is 12.8, which confirms that ngc 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude followed by ngc 1705.
179	Supported. According to the table, the redshift of NGC 1705 is indeed 633 ± 6 kilometers per second, which is the smallest value among all the entries listed in the table.
180	The statement is refuted by the table as the redshift of NGC 2082 is 1184 ± 6 km/s, while the redshift of NGC 1705 is 633 ± 6 km/s, which means that NGC 2082 has a faster redshift than NGC 1705 by 551 km/s but the uncertainty of the redshift values is not considered in this comparison. Therefore, the statement is partially supported as the redshifts are different but the uncertainty is not taken into account which makes it unclear whether the difference in redshift is statistically significant or not.
181	Based on the provided table, the statement is not supported. The table lists NGC 1574 as having a declination of °58′29″, but there is no information provided on the declination or right ascension of any other galaxy in the Dorado Group to compare.
182	Supported. The lowest right ascension (or ra) in the provided table is indeed ngc 1533 with a right ascension of 4 hours 9 minutes and 51.8 seconds.
183	The statement is not supported by the table as NGC 1515 has an apparent magnitude of 12.1 and NGC 1705 has an apparent magnitude of 12.8. Therefore, the correct statement would be "NGC 1705 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.8 followed by NGC 1515 with 12.1."
184	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, NGC 1515 has the largest redshift at 1175 kilometers per second plus or minus 7 kilometers per second. NGC 1796 has a redshift of 1014 kilometers per second plus or minus 9 kilometers per second.
185	Supported. The redshift of NGC 1705 is 633 ± 6 km/s, and the redshift of NGC 2082 is 1184 ± 6 km/s. 1184 - 633 = 551 km/s, which is within the range of 441 km/s ± 6 km/s as stated in the statement.
186	The statement is refuted by the given table as there is no mention of the declination values of any of the galaxies. The table only provides information on the names, types, right ascension (RA), redshift (km/s), and apparent magnitude of the galaxies in the Dorado group.
187	The statement is not supported by the table. The lowest right ascension value in the table is 04h04m02.7s for NGC 1515, which is less than the 4 hours 8 minutes and 58.1 seconds value mentioned in the statement.
188	Supported. The table shows that Cedar Rapids is the site with the earliest date, which is September 4, 2007.
189	The statement is supported by the table. The volleyball game has a date of September 8th, 2007, which is the second earliest date in the table.
190	The statement is supported by the table. The last row in the table is for a softball match on April 1, 2008, which is the latest date compared to all the other sports listed in the table.
191	The statement is supported by the table. The earliest date in 2008 is February 22, and the sport on that date is women's gymnastics.
192	The statement is supported by the table as the wrestling match between Iowa and Iowa State took place on December 9, 2007, which is the latest date in 2007 for any of the matches listed in the table.
193	The statement is supported by the table as the first row shows that the earliest date listed is September 4, 2007, which took place in Ames.
194	The statement is refuted by the table. The earliest date is actually September 4, 2007 - when Iowa State won a men's golf match against Iowa State with a score of 2-0. Volleyball was played on September 8, 2007.
195	The statement is supported by the table. The last sport listed in the table is softball with the date of April 1, 2008, which is the second latest date in the table.
196	The statement is supported by the table as the earliest date listed in the table is February 22, 2008 for the W Gymnastics competition held in Ames.
197	The statement is supported by the table. The latest date in the table is December 9, 2007 (row 11), and wrestling was the sport played on that day. Therefore, the statement is true.
198	The statement is supported by the table. The 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography went to Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long, who was only nominated for Outstanding Costume Design.
199	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that William Ivey Long was nominated for the Best Costume Design category at the 2005 Tony Awards for La Cage aux Folles (Musical).
200	The statement is partially supported by the table. Jerry Mitchell is indeed a winner of a Tony Award, but he is not the only winner listed in the table. The table shows that he won the Tony Award for Best Choreography in 2005 for "La Cage aux Folles (Musical)." Therefore, the statement should be revised to state: "Jerry Mitchell is a winner of a Tony Award."
201	The statement is not supported by the table. Although Jerry Mitchell is listed in the table and won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography for "La Cage Aux Folles" in 2005, the table does not mention any other nominees for that category. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether Jerry Michell was one of three nominees or not.
202	The statement is supported by the table, as the table shows that Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award in 2005 in the category of "Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical".
203	The statement is not supported by the table as William Ivey Long is listed as only being nominated for the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design. The award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005 went to Jerry Mitchell for "La Cage aux Folles."
204	The statement is refuted by the table. The nominee for best costume design in 2005 was William Ivey Long, but he did not win the award. He was only nominated for the award. The award for Best Costume Design was not won in 2005 in the La Cage aux Folles musical.
205	The statement is supported by the table. Jerry Mitchell won the Tony Award for Best Choreography for "La Cage aux Folles" and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography for the same production.
206	The statement is not supported by the table. While Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award in 2005 for Outstanding Choreography for "La Cage aux Folles," there is no indication in the table of him receiving any additional nominations for this or other productions.
207	The statement is not supported by the table. While Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award in the category of "Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical" in 2005 for his work in "La Cage aux Folles," he did not win the award. The table only shows that "La Cage aux Folles" won the Tony Award for "Best Revival of a Musical" and Jerry Mitchell won the Tony Award for "Best Choreography."
208	The provided table does not include any instance of Lleyton Hewitt winning the Masters Series Finals, as it only lists his performance in various individual tournaments. Therefore, the statement regarding Lleyton Hewitt winning the Masters Series Finals is refuted by the table.
209	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as it only includes eight of Lleyton Hewitt's matches in Master Series finals and only one of those matches ended with a score that included six points for one side. Therefore, there is not enough information in the table to support or refute the statement.
210	Supported. According to the provided table, the championship in Paris, where Lleyton Hewitt was the runner-up in 2002, had a "carpet (i)" surface. This indicates that it was played on an indoor carpet surface. No other championship in the table had a carpet surface listed. Therefore, it can be concluded that only the master series final in Paris had a carpet surface.
211	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up five times out of a total of seven championship matches mentioned in the table.
212	The statement is supported by the table. Lleyton Hewitt faced a different opponent in each of his 7 Master Series finals as listed in the table. Therefore, he never faced the same opponent in more than one Master Series final.
213	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Lleyton Hewitt has won the Indian Wells Masters Series twice, but not in 2004 and 2005. He won in 2002 and 2003. He was a runner-up in Cincinnati in 2002 and 2004, and in Paris in 2002.
214	The statement cannot be fully supported or refuted based solely on the provided table. The table only contains information about eight of Lleyton Hewitt's Masters Series finals, and not all of them resulted in one side finishing with 4 points. Additionally, the table does not provide information about the number of total Masters Series finals that Hewitt played in. Therefore, additional data and analysis would be needed to verify or refute the statement.
215	The statement is refuted by the table. While the Cincinnati tournament is listed in the table and shows that Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up in 2002 and 2004, the surface for Cincinnati is listed as "hard" and not carpet. The only surface listed as carpet is for the Paris tournament in 2002, which is shown as a runner-up for Hewitt.
216	The statement is supported by the table. In row 2 of the table, it shows that Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up in the 2000 Stuttgart Championship. Out of the 7 entries in the table, Hewitt was a runner-up once.
217	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Lleyton Hewitt faced different opponents in each of the Masters Series finals he played. In fact, Wayne Ferreira is only listed as an opponent for one of the tournaments where Lleyton Hewitt was the runner-up.
218	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 7 and 8 indicate that there were games played in the Kirin Cup on both May 17 and May 21, 1998.
219	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that there were four games in June 1998 listed under the "comp" column as "world cup" and all four games were played in different stadiums in France as listed under the "venue" column.
220	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 9, on June 1, 1998, Paraguay played against the Netherlands in Philips Stadion Eindhoven, and won 5-1 (comp: f - friendly). According to row 10, on June 3, 1998, Paraguay played against Romania in Steaua Stadium Bucharest, winning 3-2 (comp: f - friendly).
221	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Paraguay played three games in the World Cup in France in 1998 and they did not score in the first two games, which ended in 0-0 draws.
222	The statement is incorrect. According to the provided table, the game played on June 18, 1998, ended with a score of 0-0, while the game played on June 28, 1998, ended with a score of 0-0 in regular time, but was won 1-0 (after extra time) by Paraguay. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
223	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that on June 1, 1998, there was a game between Paraguay and the Netherlands, and on June 3, 1998, there was a game between Paraguay and Romania, both as part of the Kirin Cup.
224	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Paraguay played four friendly matches in February, March, and June 1998, followed by four matches in the Kirin Cup in May 1998. Then they played in four World Cup matches in June 1998 in France, not Japan.
225	This statement cannot be verified by the table as it only provides information on games that Paraguay played in 1998. There is no mention of games played by the Netherlands or Romania on June 24th or 28th.
226	The statement cannot be verified with the provided table as the table only shows the scores for Paraguayan football games from February to June 1998 and does not make any reference to the first game of the World Cup in France.
227	The statement is refuted by the provided table. The table shows that Paraguay played three matches in the 1998 World Cup, which took place on June 12, 19, and 28.

284	The statement is refuted by the table. Both Carl Osburn and Larisa Latynina have won 13 Olympic medals each, as mentioned in row 23 and rows 28-33 of the table, respectively. Therefore, Larisa Latynina does not have seven fewer medals than Carl Osburn.
285	This statement is supported by the table. Robert Garrett represented the United States, while James Connolly also represented the United States.
286	The statement is supported by the table as there is no mention of any athlete receiving a medal for the pommel horse event in the table.
287	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that several athletes received medals in gymnastics, including Carl Schuhmann and Hermann Weingartner from Germany, and Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union.
288	The statement is supported by the table. There are three translators in the 100's frequency MHz: W264BF at 100.7 MHz, W276BM at 103.1 MHz and W293AL at 106.5 MHz. There are also three translators in the 90's frequency MHz: W221BY at 92.1 MHz, W223AU at 92.5 MHz, and W240BJ at 95.9 MHz.
289	The statement is supported by the table. All of the translators listed in the table have a class of "d".
290	Supported. All of the call signs listed in the table have three-digit numbers that begin with the number 2. Specifically, the call signs listed are W221BY, W264BF, W240BJ, W276BM, W293AL, and W223AU.
291	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, w293al has an ERP of 80 watts, which is the highest among all the listed stations. On the other hand, w264bf has an ERP of only 2 watts, which is the lowest among all the listed stations. Therefore, the given statement is correct.
292	Supported. The provided table shows six entries for call signs, frequencies, cities of license, erp w, and class. Three of the entries are located in Illinois (Elgin, Englewood, and Park Forest), and three of the entries are located in Indiana (Crown Point, Rochester, and South Bend). Therefore, Illinois and Indiana each have three translators, supporting the statement provided.
293	The statement "there is a 5 MHz frequency change range" cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided as it only lists the frequencies of different call signs and their respective cities of license. The table does not provide information on frequency changes or ranges.
294	The statement is supported by the table, as all the entries in the table under the "Class" column are either "D" or "d", indicating that all the translators listed in the table are of class D. There are no entries of class C in the table.
295	The statement "the number 2 is the only erp w" is refuted by the table. The table shows that there are several values of "erp w", including 38, 10, 19, and 80.
296	The statement is supported by the table. Both W293AL and W264BF have a class of "D" and their "ERP W" values are 80 and 2, respectively. Since both are in the "D" class, they have to operate at a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 250 watts, and since they have different ERP values, it means that they don't have the same coverage area. But, as per the statement, they share the same ERP W value, which is correct according to the table.
297	Supported. According to the provided table, there is a translator with the call sign W264BF on frequency 100.7 and a translator with the city of license Englewood, Illinois. Therefore, the statement "Englewood, Illinois has two translators" is supported by the table.
298	The statement cannot be supported or refuted as the table only provides information on Katrina Adams' performance at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open from 1986 to 1999. It does not provide information on the results of these tournaments in particular years or compare the results of different tournaments in the same year.
299	The statement "the US Open had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999" is supported by the table. In both 1986 and 1999, Katrina Adams reached the first round in the US Open.
300	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Katrina Adams had multiple results at Wimbledon during 1986-1999, including one Semifinals appearance in 1995 and two Quarterfinals appearances in 1988 and 1994.
301	Refuted. The provided table shows different results for each tournament in the years 1990 and 1999. For example, at the Australian Open in 1990, Katrina Adams reached the third round, whereas in 1999, she was eliminated in the first round. The same applies to the other Grand Slam tournaments, where her performance varied from year to year.
302	This statement is supported by the table. The Australian Open had three "a" results (in 1986, 1991, and 1995) while Wimbledon had only one "a" result (in 1986).
303	The statement is supported by the table as Katrina Adams did not compete in the Australian Open in 1996 (indicated by "a" which means absent) but reached the quarterfinals in the French Open in the same year.
304	Supported. According to the provided table, Katrina Adams competed in the US Open in both 1986 and 1999. In 1986, she lost in the first round (1r), whereas in 1999, she made it to the third round (3r). Therefore, the statement "the US Open had 1r in 1986 but had 3r in 1999" is supported by the table.
305	The statement, "the wimbledon had the same result in the years 1986 and 1999", is refuted by the provided table. Katrina Adams reached the semi-finals in Wimbledon in 1986 and was eliminated in the first round in 1999.
306	According to the table, Katrina Adams had the same result in the US Open in 1990 (third round) and 1999 (second round), so the statement is refuted by the table.
307	The statement "the Australian Open had the same results as Wimbledon had" is not supported by the table. The table shows that Katrina Adams achieved different results in the Australian Open and Wimbledon tournaments in each year that she participated. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest that the two tournaments had the same results.
308	The statement is supported by the table as all the matches listed took place on June 23, 1962, indicating that the Victorian Football League season did occur on that date.
309	The statement is supported by the table. The row 5 includes the home team as Carlton and the venue as Princes Park, indicating that the game between Carlton and Footscray was played at Princes Park.
310	Refuted. According to the table, South Melbourne versus Richmond had a crowd of 17,000, while Hawthorn versus North Melbourne had a crowd of 8,470. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table, but rather, it is refuted.
311	The table provided does not provide information regarding the number of teams playing in the 1962 VFL season. Therefore, it cannot confirm or refute the statement.
312	The statement is supported by the table. In the 1962 VFL season match between Collingwood and Fitzroy, Collingwood scored 74 points while Fitzroy scored 65 points, as shown in row 4 of the table. Therefore, Collingwood scored more points than Fitzroy in their 1962 VFL match.
313	The statement cannot be verified or refuted by the given table as it only lists the scores, teams, venues, crowds, and dates of a set of matches that occurred on June 23, 1962. It does not provide information on when the VFL season began in 1962. Therefore, additional information would be needed to verify or refute the statement.
314	The statement is refuted by the table. The provided table does not include a game between Footscray and Fitzroy, and the venue column of the table does not list Windy Hill as a venue for any of the games played on June 23, 1962.
315	The statement is not supported by the table. While the crowd at the South Melbourne vs. Richmond match at Lake Oval was smaller than some of the other matches played that day, it was not the smallest crowd of the day. The North Melbourne vs. Hawthorn match at Arden Street Oval had an attendance of 8,470, which was smaller than the crowd at the South Melbourne vs. Richmond match of 17,000.
316	The statement is not supported by the provided table as there is no mention of a match between Collingwood and Hawthorn in the table.
317	Supported. According to the table, Harry Schell drove for Ecurie Bleue while Philippe Etancelin was a private entrant during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.

319	Supported. Looking at row 16 of the table, it shows that the driver was Prince Bira, the engine was Maserati L4S, and the entrant was Enrico Platé.
320	The statement is supported by the table. Toni Branca and Philippe Etancelin were private entrants and they used Maserati 4CL with Maserati L4S and Talbot-Lago T26C with Talbot L6 tires P and D respectively during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
321	The statement is supported by the table. Peter Whitehead and Luigi Villoresi are both listed as having driven a Ferrari car with a Ferrari V12s engine, and the tire code for both of them is listed as "p".
322	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Harry Schell drove for Ecurie Bleue and his entrant was Talbot-Lago. Philippe Étancelin, on the other hand, drove for a private team and his entrant was Talbot-Lago. Nino Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio, and Luigi Fagioli drove for SA Alfa Romeo, but not Philippe Étancelin.
323	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Ecurie Espadon entered an SVA-Fiat car with an SVA 1500 engine, while the Talbot-Lago T26C chassis was entered by other teams, specifically by Ecurie Belge, Automobiles Talbot-Darracq SA, Scuderia Ferrari, and Ecurie Bleue. Therefore, Ecurie Espadon did not enter the Talbot-Lago T26C chassis during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
324	Supported. The table shows that Nino Farina was driving a SA Alfa Romeo with an Alfa Romeo L8S engine, and nobody was driving a Maserati with an L4S engine during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
325	The statement is refuted by the table as Harry Schell was entered by Ecurie Bleue and Johnny Clae was entered by Ecurie Belge. Neither of them was entered as a private entrant in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
326	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Raymond Sommer drove for Scuderia Ferrari and his car was a Ferrari with a Ferrari V12 engine.
327	Supported. The table shows that 7 out of the 10 athletes listed with the longest marks in the long jump event are from the United States.
328	The statement is not supported by the table. Erick Walder had a wind of 2.0 while Bob Beamon had a wind of 2.0.
329	The statement is refuted by the table as only one athlete, Mike Powell, had a mark greater than 29 feet with a jump of 8.95m or 29ft4¼in.
330	The statement is supported by the table. Bob Beamon is listed as the athlete who set his long jump record in the year 1968, which is the earliest year listed in the table. Therefore, his record has remained unbeaten for the longest time compared to the other athletes listed in the table.
331	The statement is supported by the table. Dwight Phillips, represented the United States, set the long jump record of 8.74 meters (28 ft 8 in) on June 7, 2009, according to row 8 in the provided table.
332	The statement is supported by the table as six out of the top ten longest long jumps in history were achieved by American athletes. Mike Powell, Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis, Larry Myricks, Erick Walder, and Dwight Phillips are all from the United States and have achieved marks in the top ten. Therefore, the statement that "few athletes from the United States have the longest mark" is not accurate in the context of the table.
333	The statement is refuted by the table. In the table, we can see that the wind values vary for different athletes. For instance, Bob Beamon had a wind of 2.0 while Irving Saladino had a wind of 1.2. Eric Walder had a wind of 2.0. Therefore, the wind value was not the same for all athletes.
334	The statement is contradicted by the table as only two athletes, Larry Myricks and Erick Walder, had a mark of 28 feet or 8.53 meters.
335	The statement is refuted by the table as the record set by Bob Beamon in Mexico City was on October 18, 1968, which was over 50 years ago. Therefore, it cannot be considered recent.
336	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows records set by various athletes in the long jump event and Dwight Phillips is listed as one of the athletes who set a record, but he was not the first person to do so. Bob Beamon is listed as having set a record in 1968, which predates Phillips's record in 2009. Therefore, the statement is false.
337	It is supported by the table. Keith Miller, who took 13 wickets, appeared in all 5 matches of the Ashes series while Ernie Toshack, who took 11 wickets, appeared in 4 matches. Therefore, the statement is true.
338	Supported. According to the table, Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston both took 27 wickets each in the 1948 Ashes series. However, Ray Lindwall had a better bowling average of 19.62 compared to Bill Johnston's average of 23.33. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
339	Supported. According to the provided table, Bill Johnston from Australia took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes Series, whereas Alec Bedser from England took only 18 wickets. The table shows that none of the England players took as many wickets as Bill Johnston.
340	Supported. According to the table, Jim Laker played in 3 matches while all the Australian players mentioned (Ray Lindwall, Bill Johnston, Keith Miller, and Ernie Toshack) played in 5 matches.
341	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "average" column for each player, we can see that Alec Bedser had the best bowling average for any England player with an average of 38.22.
342	The statement is supported by the table. Keith Miller had 13 wickets and appeared in all 5 matches (row 5), while Ernie Toshack had 11 wickets and only appeared in 4 matches (row 6).
343	The statement is refuted by the table. While Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston both took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes series, Lindwall had a better bowling average than Johnston (19.62 versus 23.33). Therefore, the statement "Ray Lindwall took a higher number of wickets as Bill Johnston but had a worse bowling average" is incorrect.
344	The statement is refuted by the table as none of the England players listed in the table took as many wickets as Bill Johnston, who took 27 wickets. The highest wicket-taker among the England players listed is Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets.
345	The statement is refuted by the table. Jim Laker played in only 3 matches while all of the Australian players mentioned in the table played in 5 matches each, thus playing in more matches than Jim Laker.
346	The statement is refuted by the table. While Dave Sutton did play in the DF (defender) position for Huddersfield Town F.C. during the 1979-80 season, with a total of 6 league goals, Malcolm Brown, another DF, scored 2 league goals more than him, with a total of 8 league goals in the league. Therefore, Malcolm Brown has the most league goals among the players in DF position, not Dave Sutton.
347	The statement is supported by the table. Malcolm Brown played 46 league matches and Peter Hart played 46 league matches as well, making them the two players with the highest number of league appearances in the 1979-80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season.
348	The statement is supported by the table. Ian Robins scored a total of 25 league goals for the 1979-80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season, which is the highest number of league goals scored by any player in that season, according to the table.
349	The statement is supported by the table. Ian Robins has the highest number of total goals with 27.
350	The statement is supported by the table. Peter Hart is the only player who scored a goal in the FA Cup, with one goal in his name. The rest of the players listed have either zero goals or have not played in the FA Cup.
351	The statement "Dave Sutton has the most league goals in df positions" cannot be verified by the table as it only provides information on the number of league goals each player has scored in the 1979-80 season and not their ranking among all players who play in the defense position. Therefore, this statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
352	Refuted. While Dave Sutton has the highest number of league apps with 46, Chris Topping only has 13 league apps and therefore does not have the highest number of league apps.
353	Refuted. According to the provided table, Tommy Smith did not score any league goals during the 1979-80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season. Peter Fletcher has the highest number of league goals in the table with 17.
354	The statement is not supported by the table. While Ian Robbins has the highest number of total goals at 27, Chris Topping did not score any goals during the season.
355	Refuted. According to the provided table, only Peter Hart has scored a goal in the FA Cup during the 1979-80 season.
356	The statement is supported by the table. In May of 1991, the Toronto Blue Jays played in 8 games with an attendance greater than 50,000, as shown in rows 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 22, and 25.
357	Supported. The table shows that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Rangers twice in May during the 1991 season, on May 1st and May 7th.
358	The statement is refuted by the table. The Toronto Blue Jays won only one out of the last three games they played in May 1991 as per the table provided. They won against the Oakland Athletics on May 29, 1991, and lost against the Athletics on May 28, 1991, and the California Angels on May 31, 1991.
359	This statement is refuted by the table. The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Rangers on May 1st, with an attendance of 33,439. The game against the Royals on May 3rd, May 14th and May 15th had attendances of 20,809, 43,357 and 50,113 respectively which were higher than the game against the Rangers.
360	The statement is refuted by the table. As shown in the table, the Blue Jays won on May 25 against the Angels, lost on May 26 against the Angels, and then won on May 28 against the Athletics. Therefore, they did not lose three consecutive games between May 25th and 28th May 1991.
361	The statement is refuted by the table. The provided table does not contain any attendance figures lower than 20,636 in May of the 1991 season. The lowest attendance figure provided in the table is 20,809.
362	Supported. The table shows that on May 24th, May 25th, and May 26th, the Blue Jays played the Angels.
363	The statement cannot be completely verified as the table only shows the results of the first 31 games played in May 1991. The results of the remaining games are not included in the table. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the Toronto Blue Jays lost two of the last three games played in May 1991 based on the given table.
364	The statement is refuted by the provided table. According to the table, the game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Texas Rangers on May 1st, with an attendance of 33,439. The game against the Athletics on May 20th had an attendance of 24,631, which is higher than the May 1st game.
365	The statement is refuted by the table. The Toronto Blue Jays won their game against the Angels on May 25th, lost to the Angels on May 26th, and then won their next three games against the Athletics. Therefore, they did not lose consecutive games between May 25th and May 28th, 1991.
366	Supported. The table shows that the tournament held on June 2nd, 2003, took place in Surbiton, Great Britain.
367	Supported. According to the provided table, the tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was on April 16, 2007, which matches the statement.
368	The statement is supported by the provided table as Wesley Moodie was indeed the opponent of Alex Bogdanovic on June 2nd, 2003 in the Surbiton tournament in Great Britain.
369	The statement is supported by the table as the second row shows that the tournament in Glasgow, Great Britain on April 26, 2004, was played on carpet.
370	The statement is supported by the table. In Row 9, it is stated that on April 8th, 2013, Rik De Voest was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent in the Little Rock tournament final, and he defeated Bogdanovic 6-3, 6-2.
371	The statement "the April 26th, 2004 tournament took place in Surbiton, Great Britain" is refuted by the table. The table shows that the tournament on April 26th, 2004, took place in Glasgow, Great Britain.
372	The statement is supported by the table. The row 6 entry in the table states that the tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was played on April 16, 2007, which is not April 4, 2011.
373	The statement is refuted by the table. On 2 June 2003, Alex Bogdanovic played against Wesley Moodie in Surbiton, Great Britain. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
374	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the tournament that took place on April 26, 2004, in Glasgow, Great Britain (F1) was played on carpet, not on grass.
375	The statement is false. According to the table, Arnau Brugués-Davi was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 4, 2011, in Little Rock, USA F9, and he defeated Bogdanovic 6-3, 6-1.
376	According to the table, the statement is supported as Ben Curtis, J B Holmes, Steve Flesch, and David Toms are all listed as being from the United States.
377	The statement is supported by the table. Henrik Stenson is from Sweden and his nationality is listed in row 4. Aaron Baddeley is from Australia and his nationality is listed in row 10. Charlie Wi is from South Korea, and his nationality is listed in row 7.
378	The statement is supported by the table. In row 3 and row 4, it can be seen that J B Holmes and Henrik Stenson both tied for the second place with -1 to par, after completing the tournament with a score of 209.
379	The statement is supported by the table. Row 5, 6, and 7 show that Sergio García of Spain, Pádraig Harrington of Ireland, and Charlie Wi of South Korea all tied for 4th place with a score of +1 to par.
380	The statement is supported by the table. Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States both finished in a tie for 9th place with a score of +3 to par.
381	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Charlie Wi is from South Korea and Aaron Baddeley is from Australia.
382	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, and Charlie Wi is from South Korea.
383	The statement is incorrect. J.B. Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tied for second place with a score of -1 or 209 for the tournament.
384	The statement is refuted by the table. Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi are actually tied for fourth place with a score of +1 to par, not -1. Ben Curtis won the tournament with a score of -2 to par.
385	The statement is refuted by the table. Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States did not tie for eighth place with +4 to par, as their scores were both 213 (+3 to par), which tied them for ninth place.
386	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table as it only provides information about the different features of tanks, such as their weight, armament, speed, and engine power. It does not directly compare the vctp autocannon to the vcrt in terms of speed.
387	The statement is supported by the table as it can be seen that vca of 40t (44.1tons) is associated with vctm of 26t (28.7tons) and the 155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer is associated with vctm of 26t (28.7tons) and 120 mm (4.72in) mortar is associated with vctm of 26t (28.7tons).
388	The information provided in the table supports the statement. According to the table, the vctp has an engine power of 24hp/ton and a maximum speed of 75km/h. On the other hand, the vca 155 has an engine power of 18hp/ton and a maximum speed of 55km/h. Therefore, the statement that "vctp 24hp / t (23hp / ton) has a vca 155 of 18hp / t ( 16.5hp / ton) , and not 55 km / h (34 mph)" is supported by the table.
389	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, both VCLC and VCRT have the same weight of 32t (35.3 tons). However, VCLC is equipped with 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets while VCRT is equipped with a 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. Therefore, they do not have the same armament.
390	I'm sorry, but I am unable to answer that question with the given table. The table only provides information on the various specifications of different weapons and vehicles, such as their weight, speed, and firepower. Without further information, it is impossible to determine whether or not the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
391	Supported. From the provided table, the vctp has a 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon in row 3, while the vcrt has either a 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets and a 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun in the same row. Therefore, the statement is true and supported by the table.
392	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, the "vctm" value of "vca 40t (44.1tons)" is "28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton)" and the "vctm" value of "155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer" is "26t (28.7tons)". So, the statement is true for the vca 40t and the 155 mm l/41 howitzer, but the table doesn't provide the "vctm" value for the 120 mm mortar.
393	Refuted. Looking at the table, the row for "vctp" shows that it has a VCA of "155 mm (6.1in) l/41 howitzer", which supports the statement. However, the row also shows that the maximum speed for vctp is "75 km/h (47 mph)", which contradicts the statement that it is not 55 km/h (34 mph).
394	The statement is supported by the table. Both vclc 32t (35.3tons) and vcpc have a vcrt of 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun. However, vclc 32t (35.3tons) has 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets, while vcpc does not have any specified weapon in the table.
395	Based on the table provided, the statement cannot be verified or refuted as it does not provide information specifically about the relationship between the different vehicle models and their respective machine gun or speed capabilities. The table only lists the characteristics of each model separately.
396	The statement is supported by the table. In the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" of Gilmore Girls, the director is listed as Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
397	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Amy Sherman-Palladino was the director of three episodes in 2003 (episodes 1, 6, and 85).
398	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Amy Sherman-Palladino directed more episodes (5 episodes: row 1, 2, 6, 70, 82) than Daniel Palladino (4 episodes: row 11, 13, 18, 86).
399	Sorry, the statement "amy sherman - palladino and daniel palladino directed two episodes together" is incorrect. The table shows that Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino worked together as writers for several episodes, but each episode has a different director. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
400	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, episode 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 3.9 million viewers, while episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef?" had 5.5 million viewers, meaning there were 1.6 million more viewers for the latter episode.
401	The statement is refuted by the table. In the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" in the show Gilmore Girls, the writer was Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
402	The statement is supported by the table. Row 1 shows that there was no director for the first episode of the season, "Ballrooms and Biscotti". However, in Row 6, it shows that "An Affair to Remember" was directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino. Therefore, she directed a single episode in 2003.
403	This statement cannot be refuted or supported by the provided table as it only contains information about the director of each episode, not the total number of episodes directed by each director. To determine whether the statement is supported or refuted, we would need to have a complete list of all episodes and their corresponding directors.
404	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as it only lists the individual directors and writers for each episode and does not provide information on how many episodes were directed by each director, nor does it provide any indication of how many episodes were directed collaboratively.
405	Refuted. According to the table, Episode 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 3.9 million viewers, while Episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef" had 5.5 million viewers. Therefore, episode 69 had more viewers than episode 67.
406	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, call sign w230av has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama and call sign w269ax has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama. Therefore, the statement is correct.
407	The statement is refuted by the table. The frequency for call sign w269ax is listed as 101.7 FM, indicating that it supports that part of the statement. However, the table shows that the frequency for call sign w273ae is listed as 102.5 FM, which contradicts the latter part of the statement. Therefore, the statement "the frequency mhz for call sign w269ax and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 101.7 fm and 102.5 fm, respectively" is not supported by the table.
408	The statement is supported by the table. The city of license for w282ae is Macon, Georgia, and the city of license for w290ag is Griffin, Georgia, as indicated in the "city of license" column in rows 5 and 6 of the table.
409	The statement is supported by the table. Both w230av in Gadsden, Alabama, and w269ax in Anniston, Alabama have an ERP of 10 watts and a Class D license.
410	The statement is supported by the table. Both w290ag and w282ae have an ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of 27 watts and a class designation of "D", but w290ag is licensed to the city of Griffin, Georgia, while w282ae is licensed to the city of Macon, Georgia.
411	The statement is refuted by the table. Based on the table, the call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, not Anniston, Alabama, and the call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama, not Griffin, Georgia.
412	The statement is refuted by the table. The frequency for call sign w269ax is 101.7 FM, while the frequency for call sign w273ae is 102.5 FM. Therefore, the statement that the frequency for w269ax and w273ae is 93.9 FM and 105.9 FM respectively is false.
413	The statement is refuted by the table. The city of license for w282ae is Macon, Georgia, not Albany, Georgia. The city of license for w290ag is Griffin, Georgia, not Gadsden, Alabama.
414	The statement is supported by the table. Both w230av in Gadsden, Alabama, and w290ag in Griffin, Georgia have an ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of 27 watts and a class of D according to the table.
415	The statement is false. According to the table, the erp w and class for w290ag is 27 and d respectively with a city of license in Griffin, Georgia. Meanwhile, the erp w and class for w230av is 10 and d respectively with a city of license in Gadsden, Alabama. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the provided table.
416	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the table as it only shows the overall medal tally for all participating nations, and not the breakdown of individual sports. A more specific table or information is needed to verify the statement.
417	The statement cannot be verified because the table provided does not specifically list the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won in the sport of wushu. It only lists the total number of medals won by each country at the Asian Games.
418	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that both Singapore and Mongolia have a total of 0 gold medals in the Wushu category at the Asian Games.
419	The statement is supported by the table. The Philippines and Macau both won one gold and five silver medals for wushu at the Asian Games, but the Philippines won eight bronze medals while Macau won four. Therefore, the Philippines won a total of 14 wushu medals (1 gold, 5 silver, 8 bronze), while Macau won a total of 10 wushu medals (1 gold, 5 silver, 4 bronze).
420	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Hong Kong won a total of 15 medals (2 gold, 9 silver, and 4 bronze) in the Asian Games, while Thailand won a total of 11 medals (2 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze) in the same event. Therefore, Hong Kong won 4 more total medals than Thailand, but not in the category of wushu alone.
421	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Pakistan has won one silver and one bronze medal, while Yemen has won one bronze medal at the Asian Games. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals won by Pakistan and Yemen in wushu is two, not three.
422	The statement cannot be verified as the provided table doesn't contain the specific medal count for wushu at the Asian games. However, based on the given table, China has won a total of 53 gold medals across all sports while Iran has won only 4 gold medals.
423	The statement is refuted by the table. Myanmar has won one gold medal for wushu at the Asian Games according to the table in row 16, while Mongolia has not won any gold medals for wushu at the Asian Games. Singapore is also listed as having not won any gold medals for wushu at the Asian Games in the table.
424	The statement is supported by the provided table. According to the table, the Philippines and Macau have both won one gold medal and five silver medals for a total of six medals each in wushu. However, Macau has won four more bronze medals than the Philippines, with a total of four bronze medals compared to the Philippines' one bronze medal.
425	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Hong Kong has won 2 bronze medals in Wushu while Thailand has won 6 bronze medals in Wushu. Therefore, Thailand has won 4 more bronze medals than Hong Kong in Wushu.
426	The statement "Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points scored in two games during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season" is supported by the provided table. Stuckey scored 25 points in the game against Milwaukee on March 1st and he scored 10 points in the game against Minnesota on March 2nd, which were the highest points scored by any Pistons player in those games.
427	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the team lost six games during the period March 1 - March 26, 2011, which is the period covered in the table.
428	The statement is refuted by the table. None of the games during this period were won by the Detroit Pistons by over ten points. The only game they won was against the Toronto Raptors on March 16th, 2011 with a score of 107-93, which is a difference of 14 points. Every other game was either lost or won in overtime with a difference of less than ten points.
429	The statement is supported by the table which shows that the attendance for the game played on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center was 11,364, which is the lowest attendance recorded during the period covered in the provided table.
430	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only shows the high points, high rebounds, and high assists for each game, and not the details of other players' rebounds. The table does not provide information on whether there were instances of a tie for rebounds between players.
431	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Rodney Stuckey only led the Detroit Pistons in points in one game during this period of the 2010-2011 season, which was on March 1 against Milwaukee with 25 points.
432	The statement is supported by the provided table. During the given period of the 2010-2011 season, the Detroit Pistons lost 8 out of 12 games, which is more than eight games.
433	The statement is refuted by the table. There are no games in the table where the Detroit Pistons won by over ten points during the period mentioned. The closest game would be their win against the Toronto Raptors on March 16th, where they won by 14 points in overtime (107-93).
434	The statement is refuted by the table. The lowest game attendance during the specified period of the 2010-2011 season was on March 1st against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center, with an attendance of 11,364. The game on March 20th against Atlanta at Philips Arena had an attendance of 17,580, which is higher than the game on March 1st.
435	The statement cannot be verified or refuted by the provided table as it only shows the game results and statistics for each game. It does not provide information on the number of rebounds during the entire season. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table.
436	The statement is supported by the provided table. According to the table, Episode 2 ("Finding Freebo") had 0.79 million viewers in the US, while Episode 4 ("All in the Family") had 0.86 million viewers in the US. Therefore, it can be concluded that more viewers in the US watched Episode 4 than watched Episode 2.
437	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that KEITH GORDON directed two episodes in season 3 of Dexter. Row 1 indicates that there were a total of 12 episodes in the season. Rows 4 and 7 indicate that Keith Gordon directed episodes 4 and 7, respectively. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
438	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the first episode of season 3, "Our Father", aired on September 28, 2008, and the final episode, "I Had a Dream", aired on December 7, 2008.
439	Supported. The provided table shows that the third season of Dexter had a total of 11 episodes, listed in rows 1-11 of the table.
440	The table shows that Lauren Gussis is not a direct for any episode in Dexter Season 3, which supports the statement that Lauren Gussis is not an episode director for Dexter.
441	Supported. According to the table, in the US, the second episode "Finding Freebo" had 0.79 million viewers, while the fourth episode "All In The Family" had 0.86 million viewers. Therefore, the statement that more viewers in the US watched the second episode of Dexter's third season than the fourth episode is supported by the table.
442	The statement is refuted by the table. While Keith Gordon directed two episodes of Dexter in season 3 ("Our Father" and "All in the Family"), he did not write any of the episodes. The table shows that "Our Father" was written by Clyde Phillips, and "All in the Family" was written by Adam E. Fierro.
443	The statement is supported by the table. Season 3 of Dexter began airing on September 28, 2008, which is before October of 2008.
444	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there were a total of 12 episodes in the third season of the TV series Dexter (`no in season` column). Therefore, the statement "the tv series Dexter had more than a dozen episodes in its third season" is false.
445	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Lauren Gussis was a writer for episode 7 titled "Easy as Pie" and episode 11 titled "I Had a Dream" in season 3 of Dexter.
446	The provided table does not support or refute the statement that "the results were counted in Bhind district five times and three times in Datia" as it only provides information about the Lok Sabha constituencies within the Bhind and Datia districts, and not about election results or the number of times they were counted.
447	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Mehgaon has the highest number of electorates with a total of 210649 in the year 2009. Hence, the statement is true.
448	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table:- The number of electorates in Gohad is 166893- The number of electorates in Bhander is 139600- The difference between the number of electorates in Gohad and Bhander is: 166893 - 139600 = 27,293Therefore, the statement "gohad had 36732 more electorates in 2009 than bhander" is true as the difference in the number of electorates in Gohad and Bhander is indeed greater than 36732.
449	The table shows that Sewda had 130161 electorates in 2009. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table. Sewda had the lowest number of electorates among all the constituencies listed in the table.
450	The statement is refuted by the table. The constituency number of Gohad is 13, whereas the constituency number of Datia is 20, which means that Datia's constituency number is higher than Gohad's by 7 and not 9.
451	I'm sorry, but the provided table does not provide any information on the number of times the election results were counted in Bhind or Datia district. Therefore, I cannot support or refute the given statement.
452	The statement "mehgaon tied with datia to have the highest number of electorates in 2009" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the number of electorates in Mehgaon was 210,649 while the number of electorates in Datia was 143,593. Therefore, Mehgaon had a higher number of electorates than Datia in 2009.
453	The statement is supported by the table. The number of electorates for Gohad (row 6) is 166893, and for Bhander (row 8) is 139600. Therefore, the difference in the number of electorates between Gohad and Bhander is 166893 - 139600 = 27293, which is more than 16732. Hence, the statement "gohad had 16732 more electorates in 2009 than bhander" is true according to the given table.
454	The statement is supported by the table. As per row 7, Sewda had 130161 electorates in 2009, which is the second-lowest number of electorates among all the constituencies listed in the table.
455	The statement is refuted by the table as we can see that the constituency number for Gohad is 13 and for Datia is 22. Therefore, Datia's constituency number is higher than Gohad's by 9.
456	The statement is refuted by the table as there are multiple games played in 2003 besides the ones mentioned in the statement.
457	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that there is only one row with "invitational" under the "event type" column, and it took place in Los Angeles in the 2005 season. Therefore, the statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2005 season in los angeles" is supported by the table.
458	The statement is refuted by the table provided. Looking at the table, it can be seen that all three seasons, 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04 have events of the limited, extended and special formats, but none of them are in the standard format.
459	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table because the table only provides information about Tsuyoshi Fujita's performance in specific events, rather than the locations of the events themselves for each of the seasons. There is also no information given about any specific numbered "seasons," so it is unclear which time period is being referred to in the statement.
460	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that there was only one event in 2011, which was the Pro Tour held in Nagoya from 10-12 June 2011.
461	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table as it only provides information about Tsuyoshi Fujita's events and rankings between 1997-1998 and 2011. However, the table does not provide any information on the number of games played by Tsuyoshi Fujita in a specific year or the time duration of each game.
462	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there was an invitational event type in the 2005 season held in Los Angeles, where Tsuyoshi Fujita ranked 2nd.
463	The statement cannot be entirely confirmed or refuted by the provided table. Only some events from the seasons mentioned have their format information provided in the table. The following events from the mentioned seasons have their format information available in the table:- 2001 - 02 Grand Prix Hong Kong: Limited- 2001 - 02 Grand Prix Fukuoka: Limited- 2002 - 03 Grand Prix Utsunomiya: Limited- 2002 - 03 Grand Prix Hiroshima: Extended- 2003 - 04 Nationals Osaka: SpecialThus, based on the available information, we can say that at least some events held during the seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 were in the limited format, but we cannot confirm whether all events in those seasons were in the limited format.
464	The table provided does not mention anything about a season 5, nor does it provide information about events being held in Los Angeles and London consecutively. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
465	The statement is not supported by the table. The table lists only one event in 2011, which is the Pro Tour held in Nagoya from June 10 to 12, 2011.
466	The statement is supported by the table. Only two episodes aired in February, while three aired in January.
467	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "original airdate" column of the table, we can see that a total of 5 episodes were aired in March: "The Woman Who Knew Too Little" (March 3), "The Tell-Tale Safe" (March 10), "He Sleeps with the Chips" (March 17), "The Pen is Mightier Than the Doyle" (March 24), and "A Horse Divided" (March 31). Therefore, the statement that March was the month that aired the most episodes with five is true based on the given table.
468	The statement is supported by the table. "Fathers and Sons" (row 2) and "Duchess of George" (row 4) were both directed by Mike Clattenburg.
469	Refuted. Upon examination of the table, we can see that there are only two directors who directed two episodes. Mike Clattenburg directed episodes 1 and 3, while Robert Lieberman directed episodes 7 and 10. Therefore, there are only two different directors who directed two episodes, not three.
470	The statement is not supported by the provided table. Mike Clattenburg and Steve Scaini directed an equal number of episodes according to the table. Mike Clattenburg directed two episodes (1, 3), and Steve Scaini also directed two episodes (11).
471	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that there were two episodes that aired in January and two episodes that aired in February.
472	The statement is supported by the table. In the "original airdate" column, there are five episodes listed as airing in January: "Fathers and Sons" (January 6, 2010), "The Return of the Grievous Angel" (January 13, 2010), "Duchess of George" (January 20, 2010), "Head Over Heels" (January 27, 2010), and "The Fall of the Republic" (January 27, 2010).
473	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, none of the episodes in the series were directed by Perry Chafe.
474	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Mike Clattenburg and Robert Lieberman each directed two episodes: "Fathers and Sons" and "Duchess of George" for Clattenburg, and "The Woman Who Knew Too Little" and "The Pen is Mightier Than the Doyle" for Lieberman.
475	The statement is refuted by the table as Steve Scaini only directed one episode (row 11) while Mike Clattenburg directed two episodes (row 1 and row 3). Therefore, Steve Scaini directed one less episode than Mike Clattenburg.
476	Supported. According to the table, Carlos Cuéllar was transferred to Aston Villa for a fee of 7.8 m, which is the highest transfer fee among all the players listed in the table.
477	The statement cannot be directly verified or refuted by the provided table as it only contains information about the transfers made by Rangers FC during the 2008-09 season. The table does not include information about the transfers made by other teams in the same season, so we cannot know if Rangers had the highest amount of transfers compared to other teams.
478	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 2 to 8 in the table mention players who left Rangers FC as their contracts ended, and no transfer fee was paid for their departure. There are a total of 7 such players.
479	Supported. According to the table, Chris Burke is listed as having been transferred to Cardiff City with a transfer fee of "free" in the winter transfer window. Therefore, the statement is true that he was the only player to have a free transfer fee during the 2008-09 Rangers F.C. season.
480	Supported. The table shows that in the summer window, 19 players were either transferred, loaned out or left the team due to the end of their contract, while only 6 players were loaned out during the winter window. This supports the statement that there were more player transfers during the summer window than the winter window.
481	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 11 of the table, Carlos Cuéllar transferred to Aston Villa with a transfer fee of 7.8m, which is the lowest transfer fee of any player listed in the table.
482	The statement appears to be supported by the table. The provided table shows a list of Rangers FC's transfers for the 2008-09 season, and there are a total of 22 transfers listed with "sco" (meaning Scottish nationality) as the player's nationality. Therefore, it can be concluded that "sco" had the lowest amount of transfers at 22.
483	The statement is supported by the table where "end of contract" is mentioned in the "type" column for the players in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, indicating that they were transferred after their contract ended.
484	Supported. According to the table in row 29, Chris Burke was transferred to Cardiff City with a transfer window of winter and a transfer fee of free. This confirms that Chris Burke was one of five players to have a free transfer fee.
485	Supported. According to the provided table, there were 19 transfers/loans during the summer window and 6 transfers/loans during the winter window, for a total of 25 transactions. This means that 15 players were indeed transferred during the summer window, which is higher than the 8 transfers during the winter window.
486	The statement "Melbourne had the lowest score when playing as the away team" is supported by the provided table. In row 7, Melbourne played as the away team against Collingwood and scored 8.10 (58), which is the lowest score among all away teams in the table.
487	Supported. The table shows that the Collingwood vs Melbourne game had a crowd of 30,883, which is the largest crowd size among all the games listed in the table.
488	The statement cannot be verified by the table as it does not provide the attendance for the games in the same order in which the games were played. It is impossible to make a direct comparison between the two games in question. Additionally, the table does not contain any information about the attendance of each game, only the total number of people in attendance.
489	The statement is refuted by the table. To calculate the average of all the home team scores, we need to add up all the home team scores and divide by the number of games (which is 6 in this case). Adding up all the home team scores (91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) gives us a total of 620. Dividing this total by 6 gives us an average score of 103.33, not 15.67. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
490	Refuted. Only 2 out of the 6 away teams had a score greater than 10: St Kilda with a score of 9.11 (65) and Richmond with a score of 17.9 (111). Therefore, the statement "1/3 of the away teams had a score greater than 10" is incorrect since it implies that two out of the six away teams had a score greater than 10, while in fact, only a third of the away teams had a score greater than 10.
491	Supported. Looking at the table, Melbourne is shown as the away team playing against Collingwood in row 7. The Melbourne team scored 8.10 (58) which is the second-lowest score among all away teams on that particular date. South Melbourne had the overall lowest score with 8.15 (63). Therefore, the statement that "Melbourne had the second-lowest score when playing as the away team" is supported by the table.
492	Based on the provided table, the statement is supported. The crowd size for the Collingwood vs Melbourne game is 30,883, which is higher than the crowd size for all other games listed except for Carlton vs South Melbourne and Hawthorn vs Geelong. Therefore, the Collingwood vs Melbourne game had the third largest crowd size.
493	The statement is refuted by the table. The attendance for the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was 7,007 while the attendance for the Essendon vs Richmond game was 22,251, indicating that more people attended the Essendon vs Richmond game.
494	Refuted. To determine the average of all the home team scores, we need to sum up all the scores and divide by the number of games played. The sum of the home team scores in the table is:14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13 = 94.9There were a total of six games played, so to find the average, we divide 94.9 by 6, giving us an average of 15.82. Since the average of all the home team scores is above 12, the statement is refuted.
495	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the provided table as it only displays one game for each round of the 1972 VFL season and does not show the scores of other away teams.
496	The statement "the agricultural panel and labour panel both have 11 total members" is not supported by the table. The agricultural panel has 11 members and the labour panel has 5 members. The total number of members for each panel is explicitly stated in the table.
497	The statement is supported by the table. The party with 21 total members is Fianna Fáil. The party with the fewest total members is the Labour Party with 8 members. 21 - 8 = 13, showing that Fianna Fáil has 13 more members than the Labour Party, which is greater than the 18 difference stated in the statement.
498	The statement is refuted by the table. While the University of Dublin panel is made up entirely of members from one group of origin, none of the parties have exclusive membership in this panel. Two independent members, three Fianna Fáil members, three Fine Gael members, two Labour Party members, and one Taoiseach nominee make up the University of Dublin panel.
499	The statement "nominated by the taoiseach has the most members from one party" is refuted by the table as no single party has the most members appointed by the taoiseach. Three parties - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Independent - have an equal number of members nominated by the taoiseach, with each having 3 members.
500	The statement "industrial and commercial panel has four more members than cultural and educational panel" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the industrial and commercial panel has only one more member than the cultural and educational panel (3 vs. 2).
501	The statement "the agricultural panel has 2 members and the labour panel has 5 members" is supported by the provided table. According to the table, the "agricultural panel" has 11 members in total among all parties, with "fine gael" having 2 and "clann na talmhan" having 0, resulting in a total of 2 members. Similarly, the "labour panel" has 11 members in total, with "fianna fáil" having 0 and "labour party" having 5, resulting in a total of 5 members.
502	The statement is supported by the table. Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, while the next largest parties are Fine Gael with 9 members and the Labour Party with 8 members. Therefore, Fianna Fáil has 9 more members than the party with the second most members.
503	The statement is refuted by the table. The National University of Ireland panel is composed of only one member, and that member is an independent senator. Thus, there are no groups of origin which are made up mostly of members from two parties, including the National University of Ireland panel.
504	Based on the table provided, the statement "the agricultural panel has the most members from one party" is refuted. While Fianna Fáil has the largest representation on the agricultural panel with four members, the Labour Panel has the largest overall representation from one party with five members from the Labour Party.
505	This statement is supported by the table. From the table, we can see that the Administrative panel has 7 members while the National University of Ireland has 3 members. Therefore, the Administrative panel has 4 more members than the National University of Ireland.
506	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, ASC Diaraf won the first leg against Stade Malien 3-0, but lost the second leg 0-4, resulting in a total aggregate score of 3-4 in favor of Stade Malien. Therefore, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
507	Supported. According to the provided table, in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs, Young Africans won their match against Lavori Publici with a score of 2-0 in both the first and second legs (as shown in row 10 of the table), giving them a total of two points.
508	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Secteur 6 lost 1-2 to Enugu Rangers, with Enugu Rangers winning the first leg 1-1 and the second leg 0-1.
509	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that AS Porto Novo lost both the 1st leg and 2nd leg matches against Victoria Club Mokanda with scores of 0-1 and 0-2 respectively. Therefore, AS Porto Novo scored no points against Victoria Club Mokanda.
510	The statement is refuted by the table. In the match between Canon Yaoundé and AS Solidarité, Canon Yaoundé won with an aggregate score of 9-4, which means they only scored five more goals than their opponent, not points. Additionally, the concept of points is not used in this type of tournament format, as teams are awarded two points for a win and one point for a draw.
511	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien with an aggregate score of 3-4.
512	The statement is refuted by the provided table. According to the table, the Young Africans won their match against Lavori Publici with an aggregate score of 2-0, indicating that they earned 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
513	The statement is refuted by the table. In the table, it can be seen that Enugu Rangers won against Secteur 6. The result of the 1st leg was 1-1 and the result of the 2nd leg was 0-1, resulting in a total aggregate score of 1-2 in favor of Enugu Rangers.
514	The statement is refuted by the provided table. As per row 6 of the table, AS Porto-Novo lost to Victoria Club Mokanda with a score of 0-1 in the 1st leg and 0-2 in the 2nd leg, resulting in a total score of 0-3 and no points for AS Porto-Novo.
515	The statement "canon yaounde scored zero points against their opponent" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Canon Yaoundé scored a total of 9 points against their opponent AS Solidarité, with a score of 7-3 in the first leg and 2-1 in the second leg.
516	The statement "there is a difference of 31521 people, from the lowest to the highest and lowest fans in attendance" is supported by the provided table. The lowest attendance was on September 17th against the Giants, with 22,616 fans. The highest attendance was on September 5th against the Dodgers, with 52,270 fans. The difference between the two attendance levels is 29,654, which is greater than 31521. Therefore, the statement is accurate.
517	The statement is supported by the table, as the Giants played a total of 7 games in September.
518	The statement is refuted by the table. None of the games listed have a score of more than 10 points for either team. The highest score listed is 13-4 (Rockies won against Diamondbacks) on September 21, 2008.
519	Refuted. The table shows that player Rosales only had one loss during September (September 25) with a record of 1-1 for the season.
520	The statement is refuted by the table. The attendance was not over 50,000 at any point during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season and the highest attendance recorded was 54,137 on September 7th against the Dodgers.
521	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table since it only shows the attendance numbers for specific games during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season, and not the average attendance throughout the whole season.
522	The statement is refuted by the table as the Cardinals played 12 games in September (rows 1-3 and 22-27) while the Giants only played 10 games (rows 8-17). Therefore, the Cardinals played more games than the Giants in September.
523	The statement is refuted by the table as there is only one game listed with a score higher than 10 points, which is September 21st against the Rockies (scored 13-4).
524	The statement is supported by the table. Johnson had 10 losses (recorded on row 22) while Rosales had 1 loss (recorded on row 24) during the 2008 season.
525	Supported. According to the table, on September 5th, the Arizona Diamondbacks played against the Los Angeles Dodgers with an attendance of 52270, which is the highest attendance recorded in the table for the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season.
526	Refuted. The highest combined agg of any of the featured games was in the match between CD Elá Nguema and Primeiro de Agosto with a total of 8 goals (2-6). The match involving Saint-Louis FC and Young Africans had a combined agg of 9 goals (2-7).
527	The statement is refuted by the table. The fourth game on the list, CD Elá Nguema vs Primeiro de Agosto, had a total of 8 goals scored (2-6), while the sixth game on the list, ASC Police vs AS Real Bamako, had a total of 4 goals scored (2-2). Therefore, the sixth game on the list was a lower scoring game than the fourth game on the list.
528	The statement is supported by the table. There were only two games (row 7 and row 11) where the score was 0 - 0 for the 1st leg.
529	The statement is refuted by the table. Botswana Defence Force XI had an aggregate score of 1-2, while Arsenal (Maseru) had an aggregate score of 4-0. Therefore, the statement "Botswana Defence Force XI had a lower agg than Arsenal (Maseru)" is false.
530	The statement is true. Both Botswana Defence Force XI and ASC Police had a 1-1 score in the first leg of their respective matches.
531	The statement is refuted by the provided table. The game between Saint-Louis FC and Young Africans FC has the highest combined agg of 9, while the game between Saint-Louis FC and Eleven Arrows FC had a combined agg of 3.
532	The statement is refuted by the table. The scoreline of the match between LPRC Oilers and Mighty Blackpool (2-3) has a higher total number of goals compared to the match between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia (0-0).
533	The statement is supported by the table. The match between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia in row 7 had the score of 0-0 in both the first and second leg, resulting in a total score of 0-0.
534	The statement is refuted by the table. While Botswana Defence Force XI did have an aggregate score of 1-2 in their match against Mbabane Highlanders, there were several other teams in the tournament with lower aggregate scores, including CD Elá Nguema (2-6), Saint-Louis FC (2-7), and LPRC Oilers (2-3). Therefore, Botswana Defence Force XI did not have the lowest aggregate score in the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
535	Refuted. The table shows that only one match had a draw score during the 1st leg, which is ASC Police vs. AS Real Bamako. All other matches have different scores during the 1st leg. Therefore, there is only one team with the same score during the 1st leg, not more than two.
536	The statement is supported by the table. Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games twice, in 2008 in Beijing, China where he finished 29th and in 2012 in London, Great Britain where he finished 6th.
537	Supported. Looking at the table, Lukáš Melich placed 3rd in the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Russia.
538	The statement that "the competition type was a junior championship two times" is supported by the table. Lukáš Melich participated in two junior championships: the World Junior Championships in Annecy, France in 1998, where he finished 10th, and the European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia in 1999, where he finished 5th.
539	The statement is refuted by the table. Lukáš Melich competed in a total of 10 competitions listed in the table, and only two of them were world championships (2005 World Championships in Helsinki and 2013 World Championships in Moscow). Therefore, only 2 out of 10 competitions were World Championships, not four.
540	The provided table does not include information about the distances that Lukáš Melich threw in his last two competitions. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
541	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Lukáš Melich's best performance at the Olympic Games was finishing in 6th place at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, but he did not win a medal.
542	The statement is refuted by the table. Lukáš Melich's best finish is listed as third place at the 2013 world championships in Moscow, Russia.
543	The statement is refuted by the provided table. Lukáš Melich's highest finish was 3rd place at the 2013 World Championships, which is not listed as a junior competition.
544	Based on the provided table, the statement is supported by the data. Lukáš Melich competed in four competitions that were senior world championships: 1. 2005 World Championships (Helsinki, Finland) - 14th place 2. 2009 World Championships (Berlin, Germany) - 14th place 3. 2013 World Championships (Moscow, Russia) - 3rd place 4. 2015 World Championships (Beijing, China) - Did Not Finish.

545	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows Lukáš Melich threw for 79.36 m in the 2013 World Championships.
546	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that only one team, Hawthorn, scored less than 10 points (6.13), while South Melbourne scored 8.8 (56). Therefore, more than two teams scored less than 10 points.
547	The statement is refuted by the table. The home team Footscray scored 13.9 (87) which is less than 11.
548	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Carlton scored 121 points in their match against North Melbourne on 18 June 1938, which was the highest score among all the teams playing on that day.
549	The statement is supported by the table. None of the games played on the 18th of June drew a crowd of more than 20,000. The game with the highest crowd was Richmond vs Essendon, which drew a crowd of 20,000.
550	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that Geelong (11.23) had a higher score than Hawthorn (6.13), Fitzroy (16.12) had a higher score than South Melbourne (8.8), and Richmond (15.14) had a higher score than Essendon (15.9). Therefore, three home teams had higher scores than the away teams they were playing.
551	Supported. Looking at the table, the home and away team scores for each match are provided. Only two teams, Hawthorn and South Melbourne, scored more than 10 points. The other teams' scores were below 10. Therefore, based on the table provided, the statement "only two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored more than 10" is supported.
552	The statement is refuted by the table as the Geelong home team scored 89 points which is more than 11. Therefore, at least one home team scored more than 11.
553	The statement is supported by the table as the away team Carlton scored the highest number of points (121) among all the teams that played on 18 June 1938.
554	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the game between Geelong and Hawthorn at Corio Oval drew a crowd of 7,000 on June 18th, 1938. Therefore, at least one game drew a crowd of fewer than 20,000 on that day.
555	The statement is refuted by the table as there are no instances in which a home team had the same score as the away team they were playing against. In every game listed in the table, the home team had a higher or lower score than the away team.
556	Based on the table provided, the statement is supported. Alberto Pagani won with Linto in 1969 in the 500cc class, and he won with MV Agusta in 1971 in both the 500cc and 350cc classes.
557	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Alberto Pagani won one race in the 500cc class and one race in the 500cc class.
558	The statement is supported by the table. In 1971, Alberto Pagani won two times in the same year, once in the 500cc class with Linto and once in the 500cc class with MV Agusta.
559	This statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as there are no entries in the table indicating that Alberto Pagani has won any races.
560	The statement is supported by the table. According to the provided table, Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi ten times in various classes including 250cc and 350cc, making it the team he has raced for the most out of all the teams listed in the table.
561	The statement is not supported by the table. Although it is true that Alberto Pagani has won with Linto and MV Agusta, he has also scored points and competed for other teams after 1967, as shown by his entries in the table for the 1969, 1970, and 1971 Grand Prix seasons. Therefore, the statement is partially refuted by the table.
562	The statement you provided is not supported by the table. According to the table, Alberto Pagani only won one race in the 500cc class, in 1969, and scored a total of 15 points that season. Additionally, the table includes no data on Pagani's average points, so it cannot be verified or refuted.
563	This statement is refuted by the provided table. There is no entry in the table showing that Alberto Pagani won two times in the same year, in the 250cc class, in 1971 or any other year. In 1971, Pagani did not win any races in the 250cc class, according to the table.
564	Sorry, the statement "alberto pagani averages 40 points in races he wins in the 250cc class" cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table since Pagani did not win any races in the 250cc class according to the table.
565	The statement is refuted by the table. Alberto Pagani has raced for Aermacchi six times, according to the table (in rows 4, 7, 16, 17, 21, and 23). The table also indicates that he did not win any of those races, as all his entries show "0" in the "Wins" column.
566	Supported. The table shows that eight games were played at "the meadowlands" which is listed in the "game site" column.
567	Sorry, it seems there was an error in the statement you provided. I assume you meant "six games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season". If that is the case, then the statement is supported by the table. Six games on the table have an attendance of over 70,000: Miami Dolphins (70314), Philadelphia Eagles (72593), Buffalo Bills (71541), New York Giants (71659), Miami Dolphins (71306), and Dallas Cowboys (73233).
568	The statement is refuted by the table. The New York Jets had a record of 8 wins and 8 losses during the 1993 season, as shown in the table: they won 8 games (against the Miami Dolphins twice, New England Patriots twice, New York Giants, Indianapolis Colts twice, Cincinnati Bengals, and Washington Redskins) and lost 8 games (against the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Raiders, Buffalo Bills twice, Indianapolis Colts, Dallas Cowboys, and Houston Oilers).
569	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the Jets played the Denver Broncos in week 1 on September 5, 1993, and then played the Miami Dolphins in week 2 on September 12, 1993. So, the Jets played the Broncos before the Dolphins during the 1993 season.
570	The provided table shows that the New York Jets played two games against the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season, with the first game played on September 12, 1993, at Joe Robbie Stadium with an attendance of 70,314, and the second game played on November 7, 1993, at the Meadowlands with an attendance of 71,306. Therefore, the statement is true, as the attendance for the second game against the Miami Dolphins was indeed 992 people higher than the attendance for the first game against them.
571	The statement is refuted by the table, as there is only one instance in the table where the Jets played at a stadium named Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which occurred during Week 15 against the Washington Redskins. Therefore, the Jets played only one game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and not eight games during the 1993 NFL season.
572	The statement is refuted by the table. Only four games had an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season according to the provided table.
573	Supported. The New York Jets won 8 games and lost 8 games during the 1993 season, as indicated in the table.
574	The statement is refuted by the table. The New York Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1 on September 5th, while they played the Miami Dolphins in Week 2 on September 12th. Therefore, the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos before playing the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season.
575	The statement cannot be confirmed by the provided table. While the table does feature the Jets playing against the Patriots twice during the 1993 season (in weeks 4 and 13), it does not provide the attendance figures for either of these games. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the Jets had 992 more people in attendance in the second game against the Patriots compared to the first.
576	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Brian Sipe started 112 games while Bernie Kosar started 105 games, making Sipe starting seven more games than Kosar.
577	That statement is supported by the table. Otto Graham wore uniform numbers 60 and 14, George Ratterman wore uniform numbers 12 and 16, and Will Cureton wore uniform numbers 16 and 19 while starting as Cleveland Browns quarterbacks.
578	This statement is supported by the table. The "ties" column in the table shows that the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of 10 games.
579	Refuted. Looking at the table, there are at least 19 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks who have won more than 10 games.
580	The statement is supported by the provided table. Otto Graham has won 57 games and lost 13, resulting in a winning percentage of 81.0%, which is equivalent to winning 44 more games than he lost.
581	The statement is supported by the table. Brian Sipe started 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started 105 games, which means that Brian Sipe started eight more games than Bernie Kosar.
582	The statement is supported by the table. Quarterbacks Otto Graham, Jim Ninowski, George Ratterman, and Don Strock have all used different uniform numbers while starting for the Cleveland Browns. Otto Graham wore both uniform number 14 and 60, Jim Ninowski wore both uniform number 11 and 15, George Ratterman wore both uniform number 12 and 16, and Don Strock wore both uniform number 12 and 13.
583	The statement cannot be verified with the provided table as it only shows information regarding the starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns, including their games won, lost, ties and winning percentages. It does not provide information on the total number of tied games that the team has had.
584	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, 10 quarterbacks have won more than 30 games as starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns. They are:- Sipe, Brian: 57 wins- Kosar, Bernie: 53 wins- Ryan, Frank: 52 wins- Graham, Otto: 57 wins- Nelsen, Bill: 34 wins- Phipps, Mike: 24 wins- Plum, Milt: 33 wins- Anderson, Derek: 16 wins- Testaverde, Vinny: 16 wins- O'Connell, Tommy: 10 wins
585	Supported. According to the table, Otto Graham has won 57 games whereas Brady Quinn has won 3 games, which is a difference of 54 wins, close enough to the statement.
586	The statement is supported by the provided table. All players recorded a score of par or higher, with the lowest score being 70, which was recorded by two players (Vicente Fernández and Nick Job). Therefore, no player finished under par in the 1981 Open Championship.
587	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, there are a total of eight players who tied for 9th place with a score of 72 and a "+2" to par.
588	The statement is refuted by the table as England had more players (6) in the 1981 Open Championship compared to the United States (4).
589	The statement cannot be verified by the table as it shows that the player with the winning score in the 1981 Open Championship was Vicente Fernández from Argentina and Nick Job from England, both of whom finished with a score of 70 or even par. No player in the tournament finished with a score of 72.
590	The statement is refuted by the table. Though there were ties for certain positions in the tournament, not every position had a tie. For example, Vicente Fernández and Nick Job tied for the top position, but they were the only two players at that position. Additionally, Arnold Palmer and Bill Rogers tied for the 9th position, and while there were other players who finished with a score of 72, they were not tied for 9th place. Therefore, the statement that every position had a tie is incorrect.
591	The statement is refuted by the provided table as there were two players who finished with an even par score, Vicente Fernández and Nick Job. Therefore, the statement "no player finished under par except Isao Aoki" is not supported by the table.
592	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that there were eight players who tied for 9th place, with a score of 72 and a +2 to par. Additionally, there were two players who tied for 3rd place, with a score of 71 and a +1 to par.
593	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that England had six players, Australia had two players, and the United States had seven players in the 1981 Open Championship. Therefore, the statement that England, Australia, and the United States had the same number of players in the 1981 Open Championship with five each is false.
594	The statement is refuted by the table. In the 1981 open championship, the winning score was not 72. The score of 72 was tied by nine players who finished T9 or better, including Isao Aoki and David Graham. The winners of the championship were Vicente Fernández and Nick Job, who both shot a score of 70 (E).
595	The statement is refuted by the table. While Vicente Fernández from Argentina did finish in a tie for first place, he shared that position with Nick Job from England. Additionally, there were several players who finished in a tie for third place, including Isao Aoki from Japan, David Graham from Australia, Tony Jacklin from England, Johnny Miller from the United States, Simon Owen from New Zealand, Hal Sutton (a) from the United States, and all of them achieved their position alone. So, at least 8 players were able to obtain their position alone.
596	Supported. According to the table, the Padres were indeed the opponent for four games during the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season: September 1, September 2, September 3, and September 4.
597	The statement cannot be determined from the provided table since there are dates and opponents listed in chronological order, but not all opponents are listed for the season. Therefore, it is unknown if the Reds played the Brewers after the Padres in the 2005 season based solely on the provided table.
598	The statement is refuted by the table. There is only one game in the table, September 25 against the Cardinals, where the Milwaukee Brewers did not score any points, and they lost 0-2. Therefore, there is only one game where one team scored no points, not four.
599	Refuted. The Milwaukee Brewers played the Cardinals on September 23, 24, and 25, and then played the Reds on September 26, 27, 28, and 29 in the 2005 season.
600	The provided table for the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season does not support the statement "8 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season were attended by more than 30000 people." According to the table, only two games had attendance greater than 30000 people, and those two games were played against the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals, respectively.
601	Supported. The table shows that the Cubs were the Milwaukee Brewers' opponent three times in September 2005 (on September 20, September 21, and September 22) and therefore were the opponent four times during the 2005 season.
602	Supported. The Milwaukee Brewers played the Padres on September 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th before playing the Astros on September 9th, 10th, and 11th, as shown in the table.
603	The provided table does not support the statement that "there were 10 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season where one team scored no points".
604	The statement cannot be neither supported nor refuted by the provided table as there are no records of the Brewers playing the Yankees during the 2005 season mentioned in the table.
605	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the attendance column, only three games had an attendance higher than 30,000 (September 16th, 17th and 24th). All the other games had an attendance lower than 30,000, with some as low as 13,173. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.

608	The statement is supported by the table as the only win listed (in row 3) was achieved at the Prudential Center.
609	Supported. According to the table, Brook Lopez had the highest points for the team in games 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81.

611	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Deron Williams led the team in assists for more games than Brook Lopez. Deron Williams had the highest assists in two out of the seven games listed (April 1 and April 3), while Brook Lopez had the highest assists in one game (April 11). In the remaining four games, other players had the highest assists for the Nets. Therefore, Deron Williams led the team in assists for a total of two games, while Brook Lopez led the team in just one game.
612	The statement is refuted by the table. The table does not show any instance where Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times during the 2010-11 New Jersey Nets season.

614	The statement is refuted by the table. Jordan Farmar did not lead the team in points for any of the seven games listed in the table. The player with the highest points for each game are as follows: Brandan Wright (April 1 vs. Philadelphia), Deron Williams (April 3 vs. Miami), Brook Lopez (April 5 vs. Minnesota and April 8 vs. New York), and Dan Gadzuric (April 11 vs. Charlotte).

618	Supported. The provided table lists Nick Price as the only player from Zimbabwe, among the participants of the 1996 PGA Championship.
619	Supported. The table shows that there is only one player from New Zealand, Frank Nobilo.
620	The statement is refuted by the table as both Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks tied for the first place, but Mark Brooks earned $430,000 and Kenny Perry earned $260,000. Therefore, Kenny Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks.
621	The statement is refuted by the table. Mark Brooks, not Kenny Perry, is the player who earned the most money with a total earning of $430,000. Kenny Perry earned $260,000, which is the second-highest among all players.
622	The statement is supported by the table. Both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry finished with a score of -11 (under par), which was the best score of the tournament.

624	The table does not support or refute the statement about Frank Nobilo being the only player from Zimbabwe. The table only provides information about the top finishers of the 1996 PGA Championship and is not related to the nationality of players from Zimbabwe.
625	The statement is refuted by the table. Mark Brooks, the winner of the 1996 PGA Championship, earned $430,000 while Kenny Perry, who finished in second place tied with Brooks, earned $260,000. Therefore, Kenny Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks.

631	Supported. Looking at row 6 of the table, we can see that the chassis used in 1989 was the zakspeed 891 and the engine used was a Yamaha V8, indicating that there were in fact multiple Yamaha V8 engines used in the 891 chassis.
632	Supported. The table shows that in 1985, zakspeed only raced with the zakspeed 841 chassis, with no other chassis listed under the year.
633	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the provided table, in the year 1987, Zakspeed made only two chassis, 861 and 871, both using the Zakspeed S4 engine and G (Goodyear) tyres, and they scored a total of two points. Therefore, there is no evidence in the table that suggests the production of more than two zakspeed chassis in 1987.
634	Supported. The table shows that the zakspeed 861 chassis was used in the years 1986 and 1987, along with the zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 chassis.
635	The statement is supported by the table as both Flamengo and Fluminense hold the first two positions with 13 points each.
636	The statement is not supported by the table as it shows that the top two teams, Flamengo and Fluminense, have the same number of points (13) and also the same goal difference of 8. Therefore, they are not separated by the goal difference but by other criteria like goals for or head-to-head record.
637	The statement is supported by the table. Four teams (Portuguesa, Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, and América) have a minus goal difference, which means they have conceded more goals than they have scored. Meanwhile, only four teams (Flamengo, Fluminense, Corinthians, and Palestra Itália) have a positive goal difference, indicating that they have scored more goals than goals scored against them.
638	Based on the table provided, the statement is not supported. No two teams have the same number of goals scored against them. The team with the lowest number of goals scored against them is Flamengo with 8, while the team with the highest number of goals scored against them is América with 25.
639	The statement is supported by the table. Flamengo, Fluminense, and Corinthians all have the same number of points (13), but their position on the table is determined by their goal difference, which is 8, 10, and 4, respectively.
640	The statement is refuted by the table as both Flamengo and Fluminense have the same amount of points, which is 13, and there is no difference of 2 points between them. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
641	The statement is supported by the provided table. Flamengo finished the season in the first position with 13 points, while Fluminense finished second with 13 points as well, but with a goal difference of 5 compared to Flamengo's 8 goal difference. Therefore, there is a two-goal difference between the two teams.
642	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that only one team, Portuguesa, has a minus goal difference, while three teams (Palestra Itália, Vasco da Gama, and América) have scored more goals against them. Therefore, the statement is incorrect based on the provided data.
643	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that the team with the highest number of goals scored against them is Portuguesa with 23, followed by Botafogo and América with 25 each. Therefore, more than three teams have the same number of goals scored against them.
644	The statement is supported by the table. None of the teams have the same number of points, and the goal difference between the teams is greater than 1, ranging from 13 for Flamengo to -13 for São Paulo. Therefore, the statement is verified by the table.
645	The statement is refuted (not supported) by the table. While Geelong had a higher home team score of 13.12 (90) compared to Collingwood's 12.16 (88) in the round played on August 14, 1954, the statement only refers to the comparison of the home team scores of Collingwood and Geelong. The table shows that Collingwood's home team score was higher than Geelong's home team score for all games played during the 1954 VFL season. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
646	The statement is supported by the table. Melbourne scored 94 points as the away team against Richmond, which is the highest away team score listed in the table.
647	The statement is supported by the table. As per "row 6", the home team (North Melbourne) and away team (Footscray) both scored 9.14 (68) at the game that took place on 14 August 1954 at Arden Street Oval.
648	This statement is refuted by the table. The home team score for Collingwood was 12.16 (88) and the home team score for Carlton was 10.16 (76). Therefore, the home team score for Collingwood was 1.84 points higher than that of Carlton, not 2.00 points higher as stated in the statement.
649	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that at Kardinia Park, Geelong scored 13.12 (90) while Hawthorn scored 7.6 (48) in a match on 14 August 1954. Therefore, Geelong's score was higher than Hawthorn's score, making Kardinia Park one of the two venues where the home team scored higher than the away team.
650	The statement is refuted by the table. Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) while Geelong's home team score was 13.12 (90). Therefore, Collingwood's home team score was not three times higher than that of Geelong.
651	The statement is refuted by the table. Fitzroy is not listed as an away team in the table. The team with the highest away team score listed in the table is Melbourne, which scored 94 points in their match against Richmond.
652	The statement "the home team score equals the away team score at the game taking place at junction oval" is refuted by the table. The home team (St Kilda) scored 13.14 (92) while the away team (Fitzroy) scored 9.15 (69) at the game played at Junction Oval on August 14, 1954.
653	The statement is refuted by the table. - Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88).- Carlton's home team score was 10.16 (76).Thus, Collingwood had a home team score that was 12 points higher than Carlton, not 3.
654	Supported. Kardinia Park is listed as the venue for the match between Geelong and Hawthorn. In this match, the home team (Geelong) scored 13.12 (90) while the away team (Hawthorn) scored 7.6 (48), confirming that the home team's score was higher than the away team's score. Additionally, the table shows that this was one of three matches played in different venues where the home team's score was higher than the away team's score.

660	The statement is supported by the table. The imperial value for 厘 (lei4) is approximately 0.2133 dr, while the imperial value for 分 (fan1) is also approximately 0.2133 dr. Therefore, the imperial values for 厘 and 分 are not equal.
661	Supported. From the table, we can see that the relative value for 厘 (lei4) is 1/1600 and the relative value for 分 (fan1) is also 1/1600. Therefore, the relative values for 厘 and 分 are different from each other.
662	The statement is supported by the table. Both 斤 and 担 / 擔 have a relative value of 1, indicating that they are both considered to be a standard unit of measurement, with 担 / 擔 being equivalent to 100 斤.

The table shows that Manchester United only played Blackburn Rovers once during the 2005-06 season, and that game was played on September 24, 2005, with Blackburn Rovers winning 2-1 at Old Trafford. Therefore, Manchester United lost to Blackburn Rovers only once during the 2005-06 season.

The closest scores are 7-2 on September 1st and 6-5 on September 2nd for the Indians game, but the final scores are not exactly the same.
677	The statement is supported by the table. The Texas Rangers played the Detroit Tigers on September 12, 2006 (row 11) and September 13, 2006 (row 12). Therefore, the statement is true.

686	The statement is supported by the table. All episodes in the table were aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm.
687	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only includes information about the air date, timeslot, 18-49 demographics, and viewership of each episode. It does not include episode titles.
688	This statement is false. The table only goes up to May 20, 2009, and it shows that there were two new episodes of "Gary Unmarried" in December of 2008, but there were no new episodes in December 2009.
689	Supported. The episode "Gary and Allison Brooks" had 6.71 million viewers, which is the second-lowest viewership for the show, only higher than the season finale "Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal" with 5.55 million viewers.

The table only provides information on the air date, time slot, 18-49 viewership rating, and total viewership for each of the episodes listed, all of which aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 PM.
692	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Allison appears in a majority of the episodes in season one, not all episodes have her name in the title. For example, episodes 6, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 do not mention Allison in the title. Hence, the statement is refuted.
693	The statement is not supported by the table because the latest episode aired on May 20, 2009, and there were no episodes aired in December 2009.
694	The statement is refuted by the table, as it shows that the Boston Celtics had already lost 9 games by the end of January 1985, and the table only covers the games played until that time. Therefore, it cannot be possible that the Boston Celtics lost only three games in the entire 1984-85 season.
695	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Boston Celtics played against the New York Knicks three times during the 1984-85 season, and won all three games: on January 4 (105-94), January 7 (108-97), and March 24 (118-113). Therefore, the New York Knicks did not win a game against the Boston Celtics in the 1984-85 season.
696	The statement cannot be refuted by the provided table as it shows that the Celtics played several games at the "Boston Garden" which is listed as the home team's location in the table. However, counting the number of times "Boston Garden" appears in the "location" column shows that the Celtics played 10 games at the Boston Garden, not 8. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
697	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the highest score achieved by the Boston Celtics during the 1984-85 season was 128-127 against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 27, 1985. The score of the game against the Detroit Pistons on January 29, 1985, was 131-130, which was a close victory but not the highest score achieved by the Boston Celtics during that season.
698	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the Boston Celtics played against the Chicago Bulls at the Boston Garden on January 9th, 1985 (row 6), and there is no other game listed between these two teams at the Boston Garden during that season.
699	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Boston Celtics won 63 games and lost only 19 during the 1984 - 85 season, including the games listed in the table. So the statement "the Boston Celtics lost more games than they won in the 1984 - 1985 season" is incorrect.
700	The statement is refuted by the table because in the 1984 - 1985 season, the Boston Celtics won both the away games played against the New York Knicks (row 3, 29-6 and row 5, 108-97).
701	The statement cannot be completely verified by the provided table alone. While the table lists the games played by the Boston Celtics during the 1984-1985 season, it does not provide information on the total number of games played that season. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if less than half of the games were played in the Boston Garden based on this table alone. Additional information about the total number of games played during the season would be necessary to verify the statement.
702	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the Boston Celtics scored 104 points in their game against the Philadelphia 76ers (row 15), which is not their lowest scoring game of the season.
703	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the Boston Celtics played and won against the Chicago Bulls at the Boston Garden on January 9, 1985. Therefore, the Chicago Bulls were not the only team to play the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden and win during the 1984-85 season.
704	The statement is supported by the provided table. The table shows that out of the 10 players listed, six are from the United States.
705	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table. While the table lists players by their position and college, it does not distinguish which positions are which. Additionally, while Georgia and Penn State both have players listed in the table, it is not clear which positions they played. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they contributed two of the same position without further information.
706	The statement is supported by the table. In the table provided, John Amaechi from England, Louis Amundson from the United States, Rafael Araújo from Brazil, and Carlos Arroyo from Puerto Rico are all listed as players who joined the Utah Jazz after the year 2000.
707	Supported. Looking at the table provided, out of the 10 players listed, 9 are from the United States, indicating that the majority of the players on the Utah Jazz all-time roster are from the United States. Therefore, the statement that the United States contributed the most players of all countries is supported by the table.
708	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that after row 5, which is J J Anderson with years from 1982-85, there are four players listed with the United States as their nationality, including Louis Amundson who played in 2007. Therefore, the statement is true.
709	The statement cannot be verified as there are more than three players listed in the table who are from the United States. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
710	The statement is refuted by the table. While both Georgia and Penn State are represented in the table, neither school contributed a center and a guard. Georgia's Shandon Anderson played guard/forward, while Penn State's John Amaechi played center/forward.
711	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that after 2000, John Amaechi from England and Rafael Araújo from Brazil were the only players from their respective countries to play for the Utah Jazz.
712	Refuted. The table only includes one player from England, John Amaechi, while other countries such as the United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico also have players listed in the table. Therefore, it cannot be said that England contributed the most players of all countries.
713	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that after 1985, there were only two players from the United States on the Utah Jazz all-time roster, with the most recent being Louis Amundson in 2007. Rafael Araújo, who is from Brazil, played for the Jazz from 2006-2007.
714	The statement is supported by the table. The earliest broadcast date in the table is "May 10, 2010" for the episode "omae ga hosii". The episode "arienai kisu" was broadcasted on "May 17, 2010" which is 7 days after May 10, supporting the statement.
715	The statement is refuted by the table. "Arienai Kisu" (episode 2) had a rating of 19.2%, while "Omae ga Hosii" (episode 1), which has the earliest broadcast date, had a rating of 22.4%, indicating that the rating for "Arienai Kisu" was actually 3.2% less than the title with the highest rating on the table.
716	The statement is supported by the table. "Suki to Ietara Iinoni" (Episode 5) had a broadcast date of June 7, 2010, which is the second most recent date in the table.
717	The statement is refuted by the table. The episode with the highest ratings in the table is "ep 1| おまえが欲しい| omae ga hosii| i want you" with 22.4%. The episode "ep 3| 復讐のプロポーズ| fukusyū no puropōzu| the proposal out of revenge" had a rating of 15.6%. Thus, it did not have 2.2% higher ratings than the title with the most recent broadcast date.
718	The statement is refuted by the provided table as "suki to ietara iinoni" had a rating of 17.4%, and "saishūshōjomakuwakare" had the lowest rating with 13.4%, which is a difference of only 4%. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
719	The statement is supported by the table. "おまえが欲しい" was broadcasted on May 10, 2010, and "ありえないキス" was broadcasted on May 17, 2010, which is a gap of 7 days. Therefore,episode 2 "ありえないキス" was broadcasted 14 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date.
720	The statement is refuted by the table. The title with the earliest broadcast date is "omae ga hosii" with a rating of 22.4%, while "arienai kisu" has a rating of 19.2% which is 3.2% less than "omae ga hosii".
721	The statement is supported by the table. "Fukusyū no puropōzu" had a broadcast date of May 24, 2010, which is more recent than the broadcast dates of the first and second episodes but less recent than the broadcast dates of the remaining episodes.
722	The statement is refuted by the table as "fukusyū no puropōzu" had a rating of 15.6% while "suki to ietara iinoni" had a rating of 17.4%, which is 1.8% higher than "fukusyū no puropōzu".
723	This statement is refuted by the table. The episode with the lowest ratings is "saishūshōjomakuwakare" with a rating of 13.4%. The episode "suki to ietara iinoni" had a rating of 17.4%, which is only 2% higher than the episode with the lowest ratings. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
724	Supported. Looking at the table provided, the South Dragons had the best win-loss record with only 8 losses throughout the 2008-09 NBL season. They also had a higher percentage of cumulative points and games won compared to the other teams in the league. Therefore, the statement "South Dragons won the most games in the season" is supported by the provided table.
725	Refuted. According to the table, South Dragons have a better away record compared to Melbourne Tigers. South Dragons have a record of 9 - 6 while Melbourne Tigers have a record of 9 - 6 as well but with a lower percentage of points.
726	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the New Zealand Breakers lost two games more than the Melbourne Tigers, which means that the New Zealand Breakers lost a total of 12 games in the 2008-09 NBL season, while the Melbourne Tigers lost 10 games.
727	The statement is supported by the table. The Gold Coast Blaze had the most losses (22) and the lowest percentage of wins (26.67%) out of all the teams in the 2008-09 NBL season, indicating that they had the worst record.
728	The statement is supported by the table as both Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles have 13 losses recorded in the Loss column of the table.
729	The statement is refuted by the table. The Gold Coast Blaze won only 4 games in the season, while some of the other teams such as the South Dragons, Melbourne Tigers, and Perth Wildcats won a higher number of games. Therefore, Gold Coast Blaze did not win the most games in the season.
730	The statement is supported by the table. Both Melbourne Tigers and South Dragons have a home record of 11-4.
731	The statement is supported by the table. The New Zealand Breakers, located in row 3, have 12 losses while the Melbourne Tigers, located in row 2, have 10 losses. Therefore, the New Zealand Breakers won two games more than the Melbourne Tigers.
732	The statement is refuted by the table. Gold Coast Blaze had the worst record in the 2008-2009 NBL season, with 22 losses and only 26.67% of games won. The team with the best record in the season was South Dragons, with only 8 losses, 73.33% of games won, and a percentage of points of 110.25.
733	The statement is supported by the table as both Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles have a 56.67% win record for the 2008-09 NBL season.

736	The statement is supported by the table. The games where no goals were scored by either side are: - December 30, 2000: Sheffield Wednesday 0 - 2 Bolton Wanderers (away)- March 7, 2001: Sheffield Wednesday 0 - 0 Portsmouth (home)- May 6, 2001: Sheffield Wednesday 0 - 0 Crewe Alexandra (home)
737	The statement is supported by the table. The game on 14 April 2001 against Crystal Palace was a 4-1 victory at home, and the game on 24 February 2001 against Blackburn Rovers was a 0-2 loss away.
738	The table does not support the statement that the shortest time between two consecutive matches was 2 days for the Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season in 2000-01. The minimum number of days between two matches recorded in the table is 3, as seen in the rows for matches played on December 26, 2000 against Bolton Wanderers (away) and December 30, 2000 against Huddersfield Town (away).
739	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the attendance for the March 7, 2001 match against Portsmouth was 20,503 and the attendance for the February 21, 2001 match against Nottingham Forest was 23,266. Therefore, both matches had attendances under 25,000.
740	The statement is refuted by the table. The match with the highest attendance was against Sheffield United on April 1, 2001, with an attendance of 38,433.

742	The statement is refuted by the table. The match on April 14, 2001, Sheffield Wednesday FC won against Crystal Palace with a score of 4-1, but the match on February 24, 2001, Sheffield Wednesday FC lost against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a score of 0-2.
743	We cannot determine the accuracy of the statement using the given table. The table only provides the dates and results of each match in the 2000-01 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season, but not the specific time intervals between matches.
744	The statement is supported by the table. Olga Govortsova's best performance in grand slam tournaments is reaching the third round at the French Open in 2008 and 2009, and reaching the second round in the other three grand slam tournaments. There is no record of her reaching a final in any grand slam tournament.
745	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova has advanced to the fourth round in a Grand Slam tournament, specifically in the French Open in 2008.
746	The statement is refuted by the table. Olga Govortsova was eliminated in the first round of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open in the years 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. However, she reached the third round of the French Open in 2008 which means she won at least one grand slam match that year.
747	The statement is supported by the table. Olga Govortsova's year-end ranking decreased or remained the same every year from 2007 to 2011, as indicated by the following information in row 23 of the table:- 2007: year-end ranking of 49 - no increase from previous year (not available in the table)- 2008: year-end ranking of 49 - no increase from previous year- 2009: year-end ranking of 52 - decreased from previous year- 2010: year-end ranking of 74 - decreased from previous year- 2011: year-end ranking of 114 - decreased from previous year.
748	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open in both 2008 and 2009.
749	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows Olga Govortsova's performance in Grand Slam tournaments from 2007 to 2011, and there is no indication that she reached a final in any Grand Slam tournament during that time period. The best performance listed for her is reaching the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009.
750	The statement is not supported by the table. Olga Govortsova has advanced to the third round of the French Open in both 2008 and 2009.
751	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova had only won a maximum of 3 grand slam matches in a single year during the given period of 2007-2011.
752	The statement is refuted by the table. Olga Govortsova's  WTA year-end ranking has not always gone up from 2007-2011. It went down from 2008 to 2009, and also from 2009 to 2010.
753	The statement is refuted by the table. Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009 but only reached the second round in 2010 and 2011. Therefore, she did not advance to the third round in the French Open five years in a row.
754	That statement is supported by the table. The match listed in row 10 resulted in a draw, while all other matches listed show a clear winner and loser.
755	Supported. According to the provided table, there are 9 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. Therefore, there were more win results than loss results.
756	Based on the table provided, the statement "only two matches were played through three rounds" cannot be confirmed or refuted as there are several matches listed with no information on how many rounds were played. The table only shows the round in which the match was finished for some of the matches.
757	Yes, that statement is supported by the table. In row 8 of the table, Tim Lajcik won against Joe Campanella with a TKO in just 18 seconds, making it the shortest match in the table.
758	The statement is false. Tim Lajcik's match with the longest time was against Osami Shibuya, which he won via decision (unanimous) at Pancrase - 2001 neo - blood tournament second round. The match lasted for 5 minutes (round 3: 5:00). The match against Eugene Jackson lasted for 9 minutes and 49 seconds (row 13).
759	The statement is supported by the table. Row 10 shows that Tim Lajcik's fight against Ron Waterman in UFC 22 resulted in a draw.
760	Based on the provided table, the statement "there were fewer win results than loss results" is not fully supported. There are a total of 9 losses, 5 wins, and 1 draw in the table. While there are more losses than wins, it is not accurate to say that there were "fewer" wins than losses since the difference is only 4. Additionally, there is a draw, so technically there were more non-loss results (6) than losses (9).
761	Looking at the table provided, there is only one match that was played through three rounds, which is row 10 - "draw| 4-1-1| ron waterman| draw| ufc 22| 3| 5:00". Therefore, the statement "more than two matches were played through three rounds" is refuted by the table.
762	The statement is not supported by the provided table. The match with the shortest time was actually won against Joe Campanella with a time of 0:18 as shown in row 8 of the table.
763	The statement is false. The match with the longest time was against Eugene Jackson and it lasted for 9 minutes and 49 seconds, while the match against David Ross ended in a TKO after 5 minutes and 36 seconds.
764	The statement is supported by the table. In 12 out of the 13 games played in November, Carmelo Anthony was the highest scorer for the Denver Nuggets, scoring 42, 25, 23, 30, 20, 32, 37, 30, 27, 22, and 50 points in each of the respective games. The only game where he was not the highest scorer was against the Hawks, where he scored 30 points while someone else scored 36 points for the opposing team.
765	The statement is supported by the table. During the span listed in the table (games 3-16), the Denver Nuggets played a total of six games at the Pepsi Center (games 3, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 16) and won all of them, as indicated in the "score" column by the letter "W" (for win) and the scores listed next to them.
766	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "location attendance" column in the table, the attendance of all the games played at the Pepsi Center (home games) is listed as 15,823 or higher, which confirms that the attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center in the 2009-10 Denver Nuggets season was over 15,000.
767	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that Denver won games 3, 4, and 5 in a row, then lost one (game 7), won one (game 8), lost one (game 9), and won three in a row (games 10, 11, and 12). Therefore, Denver did not lose more than one game in a row during November.
768	The statement is supported by the table. As per the table, Chauncey Billups led or tied for the lead in assists in 10 out of the 13 games listed (on rows 1-13). Specifically, Billups had 12 assists in game 1, 5 assists in game 3, 12 assists in game 8, 5 assists in game 9 (tied with Lawson), 8 assists in game 10, 6 assists in game 11 (tied with Lawson), 7 assists in game 13 and 5 assists in game 14.
769	The statement is supported by the table. In 10 out of the 13 games played in November mentioned in the table, Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer for the Nuggets.
770	The statement is refuted by the table as the Denver Nuggets won all six games played at the Pepsi Center during this span (games 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, and 16).
771	The statement is partially supported by the table. The attendance of some games at the Pepsi Center was over 19,000, however, not all games had an attendance of over 19,000. For example, the attendance of the November 1st game against the Grizzlies was 15,823, while the attendance of the November 11th game against the Bucks was 12,987. However, the attendance of several other games, including the November 13th game against the Lakers and the November 16th game against the Raptors, was over 19,000. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it is not entirely accurate.
772	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the provided table, Denver Nuggets lost only one game in a row during the entire month of November.
773	The statement is not supported by the provided table. The table only shows the assist leaders for each game, and it does not provide a full breakdown of the number of times each player led or tied for the lead in assists over the course of the season. Additionally, there were only nine games listed in the provided table that Ty Lawson played in during the 2009-10 season.
774	The statement is supported by the table. The attendance figure for the game against Washington on February 9th, 2010 was 12,376, which is the lowest attendance figure listed in the table.
775	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that Stephen Jackson is listed as the high scorer for six out of the ten games recorded in the table. Therefore, Stephen Jackson led the team in points for the most games.
776	The statement is supported by the table. In row 6, it is seen that Nazr Mohammed had 20 rebounds in a game against Minnesota.
777	Supported. By looking at the provided table, it can be seen that Raymond Felton led the team in assists four different times for the 2009-10 Charlotte Bobcats season. He led the team in assists with 4 assists on February 1st, 7 assists on February 6th, and 5 assists on both February 9th and February 22nd.
778	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, the Bobcats had a record of 4 wins and 6 losses during the 2009-10 season through their first 10 games, not 3 wins and 7 losses.
779	Supported. The table shows that the attendance for the game against Washington on February 9th was 12376, which is the second lowest attendance figure for a game in the table.
780	The statement cannot be fully supported or refuted by the given table alone as it only shows the scoring leaders for each game and not the total number of games where Stephen Jackson led the team in points. However, we can infer from the table that Stephen Jackson did lead the team in points for at least six out of the eleven games listed in the table (games 48, 49, 50, 51, 54, and 55), which is less than half of the total number of games in the given table (11). So, it may be possible that the statement is supported by the given table.
781	The statement is supported by the table. In row 6, it can be seen that Nazr Mohammed had 20 rebounds in the game against Minnesota on February 10, 2010. Therefore, the statement is true.
782	This statement cannot be determined from the provided table. The table only shows the players who had the highest number of assists per game for each individual game of the season. It does not provide a full breakdown of each player's total number of assists for the entire season. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if Raymond Felton led the team in assists less than four different times based solely on this table.
783	Refuted. Looking at the "record" column of the table, we can see that the bobcats had 27 wins and 29 losses during the 2009-10 season. This means that they had more losses than wins.
784	The statement is supported by the table. In 2007, the Dundee Hurricanes won 9 out of their 10 games, giving them a win percentage of 90%. Additionally, the table shows that the team was promoted to a higher division (Division 1 North) following their successful 2007 season.
785	The statement is supported by the table. The Hurricanes had a record of 3 wins and 4 losses in 2006 (row 5), and a record of 2 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie in 2009 (row 8).
786	The statement is supported by the table. In 2008, the Dundee Hurricanes had 3 ties, which is the highest number of ties they had in any season listed in the table.
787	The statement is supported by the table as the "wins" column for both 2003 and 2004 shows 6 victories.
788	The statement is supported by the table. The final position for the 2009 season was 5/7, which is the lowest final position of all the seasons listed in the table.
789	The statement is refuted by the table. In 2007, the Dundee Hurricanes won 9 games out of 10, which is a winning percentage of 90%, and they were promoted to division 1 north as indicated in row 6 of the table.
790	The statement is refuted by the table. The Dundee Hurricanes had only two losing seasons in 2003 and 2009, as they won 6 games in 2004, 5 games in 2005, 3 games in 2006, 9 games in 2007, 5 games in 2008.
791	The statement is supported by the table. In the 2003 season, the Dundee Hurricanes had 0.0 ties. Therefore, they did not have any ties in 2003, and therefore the statement is false.
792	This statement is supported by the table as the number of wins for the Dundee Hurricanes varies across all seven seasons, meaning they did not win the same number of games in any of the seasons they played between 2003 and 2009.
793	Based on the provided table, this statement is refuted. There are actually four projects that have been completed: - Flowood Site in Rankin County - Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals in Marion County - Walcott Chemical Co. Warehouses in Washington County - Potter Co. in Copiah County Therefore, the statement "only three of the projects have been completed so far" is not supported by the table.
794	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Chemfax, Inc. site and the Potter Co. site were both proposed but never listed, with no construction completed. Therefore, these two projects were proposed but never listed or completed.
795	The statement is supported by the table. The "Flowood Site" and "Sonford Products" are listed in the table and both are located in Rankin County, Mississippi. The Flowood Site was proposed on September 8th, 1983, listed on September 21st, 1984 and construction was completed on September 17th, 1993. The Sonford Products site was proposed on September 27th, 2006 and listed on March 7th, 2007.
796	The statement is supported by the table as the table shows that the first project proposed in Mississippi was Potter Co in Copiah, with a proposed date of 05/10/1993, but it has not yet been listed.
797	The statement is partially supported by the table. According to the table, construction was completed on the Flowood site in 1993. However, the table shows that the construction was completed on the Newsome Brothers/Old Reichold Chemicals project in 1997, but the project was partially deleted in the table.
798	The statement is not supported by the table. Out of the ten entries in the table, only two projects have a construction completion date listed - "Flowood Site" in Rankin County and "Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc" in Marion County. The construction completion dates for these two projects are September 17, 1993, and August 8, 1997, respectively. Therefore, only one of the completed projects was completed between 1993-1997.
799	According to the provided table, one of the projects (Chemfax, Inc.) was proposed in 1993 but was never listed. Therefore, the statement that two projects were proposed and listed during 1993 but were never completed is refuted by the table.
800	The statement is supported by the table. Two Superfund sites in Rankin County are listed in the table: "Flowood Site" and "Sonford Products." Both sites were proposed and listed on September 8, 1983, and September 27, 2006, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that Rankin County was home to multiple Superfund sites that were proposed and listed.
801	The table provided does not support or refute the statement. While the table does include Potter Co as one of the sites listed, it does not provide a chronological order of when the sites were proposed and listed. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the table whether Potter Co was the first project proposed but the last to be listed.
802	The statement is not supported by the table. Although the Flowood Site and Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. are both listed as Superfund sites in Mississippi, they did not have the same time frame for construction completion. According to the table, construction at the Flowood Site was completed on September 17, 1993, while construction at Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. was completed on August 8, 1997.
803	The statement is incorrect. The provided table shows that there were 18 matches in total during the New Zealand Rugby Union Tour of Britain and Ireland which took place from October to December 1978.
804	The statement is supported by the table. There were 4 test matches played during the last 2 months of 1978: Ireland, Wales, England, and Scotland.
805	Supported. According to the table, four opposing teams scored exactly 12 points against Cambridge University in the New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland in 1978.
806	The statement is supported by the table as there was a tour match held on October 28, 1978 (London Counties), and a test match held on November 25, 1978 (England) at Twickenham, London.
807	This statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that there were three matches held in October 1978 (against Cambridge University, Cardiff, and the West Wales XV), not five.
808	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the first test match was played on November 4, 1978, followed by the second test match on November 11, the third on December 9, and the fourth and final test match on December 16, 1978.
809	The statement is supported by the provided table. According to the table, in the match against Cambridge University on October 18, 1978, the opposing team only scored 12 points, which is not more than 10.
810	The statement is false. There was only one match held in November in Twickenham, London, which was the test match against England on November 25th, 1978. This match was not a tour match, it was a test match.
811	The statement is refuted by the table as only two of the five matches held in October 1978 took place after the 25th of the month (Cardiff on October 21st and Swansea on October 25th). The other matches took place on October 18th, October 28th, and October 31st.
812	The statement is supported by the table.
813	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that on September 22, 1997, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Yankees and won with a score of 8-1, and the attendance for the game was 23,380.
814	Supported. Looking at row 28 of the provided table, we can see that the Blue Jays' record after the September 28th win against the Red Sox was 76-86.
815	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that on September 8th, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Angels, and the final score was 12-10 in favor of the Blue Jays.

817	Supported. The table shows that the Blue Jays played against the Mets on September 1 with a score of 3-0, which is the lowest combined score of any game they played that month.
818	The statement is supported by the table. The record for the Toronto Blue Jays is shown as 76-86 after their loss to the Red Sox on September 28th.
819	The statement is refuted by the provided table. Nowhere in the table does it show that the Blue Jays scored 12 runs in a single game during the month of September in the 1997 season. The highest number of runs they scored in a single game during that month was 12 on September 27th against the Red Sox.
820	The statement is refuted by the table. The row for September 25th shows that the Blue Jays won 4-3 against the Orioles, and Chris Carpenter was credited with the win, not Mike Mussina.
821	The statement is refuted by the table. Based on the provided table, Dundee West has a higher swing to gain point (2.13) than Western Isles (2.91). Therefore, the statement "dundee west has lower swing to gain points than western isles" is not supported by the table.
822	The statement is refuted by the table. Only six of the eleven constituencies listed in the table had the SNP in second place in the 2003 Scottish Parliament General Election. The remaining five constituencies had other political parties in second place in the 2003 election.
823	Supported. The table shows that the winning party for Galloway & Upper Nithsdale in 2003 was Conservative (row 2). The winning party for Paisley South in 2003 was Labour (row 11).
824	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 8 of the table, Glasgow Govan had a result of "SNP gain" in the 2007 Scottish Parliament General Election. Therefore, it is one of the four constituencies with a result of "SNP gain".
825	The statement is not supported by the table. The table lists the swing to gain points for various constituencies in the Scottish Parliament election in 2007. The lowest swing to gain point in the table is 0.17, which is the swing to gain point for the constituency of Galloway & Upper Nithsdale, won by the Conservative Party in 2003. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is the lowest swing to gain points in the entire election. The swing to gain points for all constituencies are not provided in the table, so we cannot determine if this statement is accurate based on the given data.
826	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Dundee West had a swing to gain of 2.13, while Western Isles had a swing to gain of 2.91. Therefore, Dundee West had a lower swing to gain compared to Western Isles.
827	The statement is refuted by the provided table. In rows 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 11, the Scottish National Party (SNP) had the second-place position in the 2003 election, which means they were not in third place. However, in rows 4, 5, 6, and 7, the SNP did have the third-place position in 2003. Therefore, the statement is only partially true and partially false.
828	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the winning party in Galloway & Upper Nithsdale in 2003 was the Conservative party and they held the seat in the 2007 election. The winning party in Paisley South both in 2003 and 2007 was Labour.
829	The statement is supported by the table. Glasgow Govan is listed in row 7 of the table and its result is "2nd| SNP gain". This means that the SNP gained the seat in the Glasgow Govan constituency in the 2007 Scottish Parliament general election.
830	The given statement is not supported by the provided table because 0.17 is the swing to gain points for the winning party in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale constituency, but it is not the highest swing to gain points for any party in the entire Scottish Parliament election, 2007. The highest swing to gain in the table is 4.91 points by the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the Paisley South constituency.
831	Supported. Steve Stricker's total score was 139 (70 + 69), while Phil Mickelson's total score was 143 (70 + 73), indicating that Stricker's score was lower than Mickelson's.
832	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Graeme McDowell is also a player from Northern Ireland who participated in the 2006 U.S. Open golf tournament.
833	The statement is supported by the table. Both Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy scored a +1 to par during the 2006 U.S. Open golf tournament.
834	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that Steve Stricker, who is listed as representing the United States, has a score of 139, which is the best score out of all the American players listed in the table. Jim Furyk and Phil Mickelson, the other two American players listed, have scores of 142 and 143, respectively, which are not as good as Stricker's score. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
835	Supported. The table shows that there are indeed five players from the United States: Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Jason Dufner, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser.
836	The statement is refuted by the table. Steve Stricker had a score of 139 and Phil Mickelson had a score of 143, indicating that Mickelson had a higher score than Stricker. Additionally, the table shows that Stricker is from the United States, not Scotland.
837	The statement is refuted by the table provided. While both Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell are listed in the table, their country of origin is different. Pádraig Harrington is listed as being from Ireland, not Northern Ireland, while Graeme McDowell is listed as being from Northern Ireland.
838	The statement is supported by the table. Both Kenneth Ferrie of England and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia scored a +1 to par at the 2006 U.S. Open (Golf).
839	Supported. According to the provided table, Steve Stricker of the United States has a score of 70 + 69 = 139, which is the lowest score among all the players listed.
840	Refuted. There is only one player from England, Kenneth Ferrie, in the table during the 2nd round of the 2006 U.S. Open. On the other hand, there are five players from the United States. Therefore, there are more players from the United States than from England in the event during the 2nd round.
841	The statement is refuted by the table. Princes Park is not listed in the table, and the venue with the highest crowd listed is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) with a crowd of 49,469. The Junction Oval had a crowd of 16,249, lower than the MCG but still higher than any other venue listed in the table. Therefore, the statement that the Princes Park venue had more crowd than the Junction Oval menu is not supported by the table.
842	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that North Melbourne scored 17.19 (121) against St Kilda on June 7, 1975. This was the highest score achieved by any of the away teams on that day.
843	The statement is refuted by the provided table. In the table, Fitzroy scored 97 points while Footscray scored 89 points, indicating that Footscray scored fewer points than Fitzroy. Therefore, the statement that "Fitzroy has a higher score than Footscray" is refuted.
844	The statement is supported by the table provided. All the matches took place on June 7, 1975.
845	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Kardinia Park hosted a game between Geelong and Melbourne, with a crowd of 13,328 people, Moorabbin Oval also hosted a game on the same day between St Kilda and North Melbourne, with a larger crowd of 17,811 people. Therefore, Moorabbin Oval attracted a bigger crowd than Kardinia Park during the 1975 VFL Season.
846	The statement is refuted by the table. The crowd for the game played at Princes Park between Hawthorn and Collingwood was 23,830 while the game played at Junction Oval between Fitzroy and Carlton had a crowd of 16,249. Therefore, Princes Park had a significantly larger crowd than Junction Oval.
847	Supported. The table shows that North Melbourne had a score of 121, which was the second-highest score among all away teams in the given round.
848	The statement is refuted by the table. The highest score in the given table is Hawthorn with a score of 19.24 (138), while Fitzroy's score was 15.7 (97). Therefore, Fitzroy did not have a higher score than any of the other teams in the table.
849	The statement is refuted by the table as all of the matches occurred on the same date, which was the 7th of June, 1975.
850	Refuted. The table shows that Geelong played against Melbourne at Kardinia Park and had a crowd of 13328. St. Kilda played against North Melbourne at Moorabbin Oval and had a crowd of 17811. Therefore, Moorabbin Oval had more crowd than Kardinia Park did during the 1975 VFL season.
851	The statement is supported by the table. Adding up the "races" column for each row from 1995 to 2008 gives us a total of 190 races for Shane Hall during those years.
852	The statement is supported by the provided table. The total finishes for Shane Hall between 1995 and 2008 adds up to 318.4 and when divided by the total number of races he participated in, which is 164, the resultant value is 31.39, which is the average finish.
853	Supported. According to the provided table, Shane Hall ran races for five different teams from 1995-2008. The team he ran the most races for was Stegell Motorsports with a total of 75 races. This is more than any of the other teams he ran for during his career.
854	The statement is supported by the table. Shane Hall had a total of 7 top 5 placements but had a higher number of top 10 placements, with a total of 23.
855	The statement is not supported by the table as it shows that Shane Hall only participated in two races in the year 2000, with one DNF (Did Not Finish) and one finish with a position of 35, as shown in row 7 of the table. This means that Shane Hall had a 50% DNF rate for his races in 2000, but not half of his races resulted in a DNF.
856	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that Shane Hall ran a total of 186 races between the years of 1995-2008.
857	According to the provided table, the statement that Shane Hall had an average finish of 33.39 between 1995-2008 is supported by the data. The average finish of Shane Hall during this period can be calculated by adding up the "Finish" column of each row and dividing the sum by the number of rows. (24.0 + 26.4 + 27.1 + 24.9 + 25.8 + 35.0 + 27.9 + 27.0 + 35.8 + 31.4 + 40.9 + 38.9 + 43.0) / 13 = 33.39Therefore, the statement is supported by the given data.
858	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as Shane Hall ran 33 races with Hensley Racing in 2001, but he also ran 31 races with Stegell Motorsports in 1998.
859	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table because Shane Hall only placed top 5 one time (in 1999) and placed top 10 four times (in 1997, 1998, and twice in 1999). Therefore, the statement is false based on the data in the table.
860	The supported/refuted verdict for the given statement "in the year 2001 Shane Hall had DNF half his races" using the provided table is:SUPPORTEDAccording to the table, Shane Hall participated in 33 races in the year 2001 and had a total of 6 DNFs throughout the season. As 6 is half of 33, the statement is supported by the table.
861	Refuted. The table shows that the apparent magnitude of irregular galaxy NGC 5408 is 14.0, while the apparent magnitude of spiral galaxy NGC 5457 is 8.7. Therefore, the difference in apparent magnitudes between the two object types is 5.3, not 2.1.
862	Refuted. According to the provided table, the apparent magnitude of a spiral galaxy (8.7) is less than that of an irregular galaxy (14.0) and an irregular galaxy (14.5). This shows that spiral galaxies do not necessarily have the least apparent magnitude.
863	The statement is supported by the table. As per the provided table, there are two entries for irregular galaxies in the NGC objects list from 5001-6000. The NGC number for the first entry is 5408 and for the second entry, it is 5477. Therefore, it can be concluded that irregular galaxy has two ngc numbers in the list.
864	The statement is supported by the table as the apparent magnitude of the irregular galaxy listed (NGC 5408) is 14.0 and the apparent magnitude of the globular cluster listed (NGC 5466) is 10.5. Therefore, the globular cluster has a lower apparent magnitude and is therefore brighter than the irregular galaxy.
865	The statement is refuted by the table. The globular cluster with the NGC number 5466 has a declination of 32′04″, which is not the second-highest declination in the list. The spiral galaxy with the NGC number 5474 has a higher declination of 39′45″ than the globular cluster, which means it has the second-highest declination in the list.
866	Refuted. According to the table given, the irregular galaxy (NGC 5477) has an apparent magnitude of 14.5 and the globular cluster (NGC 5466) has an apparent magnitude of 10.5. Therefore, the irregular galaxy has 4 more apparent magnitude than the globular cluster and not 2.1.
867	Refuted. The provided table shows that "Spiral galaxy" is one of the object types in the list of NGC objects (5001-6000) and their apparent magnitude ranges from 8.7 to 11.9. However, the object with the highest apparent magnitude is the "Irregular galaxy" with an apparent magnitude of 14.5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the statement "Spiral galaxy have the most apparent magnitude" is refuted by the provided table.
868	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows two rows which correspond to spiral galaxies with NGC numbers 5457 and 5474, respectively.
869	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 lists an irregular galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 14.0 followed by a globular cluster in Row 4 with an apparent magnitude of 10.5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the globular cluster has a lower apparent magnitude and is brighter than the irregular galaxy, refuting the statement. However, if we reverse the statement to state that "irregular galaxy has more apparent magnitude than globular cluster" then it would be supported by the table.
870	The statement is refuted by the table. The spiral galaxy with the second highest declination (j2000) in the list is NGC 5474 with a declination of degree 39′45″. However, it is not the spiral galaxy with the highest declination (j2000) in the list. NGC 5466, a globular cluster in the constellation Boötes, has the highest declination (j2000) in the list, with a declination of degree 32′04″.
871	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the highest crowd participation during the 1961 VFL season was at the MCG, with a crowd of 49,678 spectators attending the match between Melbourne and Carlton on the 3rd of June 1961. The other venues listed in the table, including Arden Street Oval, Glenferrie Oval, Victoria Park, Kardinia Park, and Lake Oval, all had smaller recorded crowds in comparison.
872	The statement is supported by the table, as Kardinia Park is listed as the venue for the match between Geelong and Footscray on June 3, 1961.
873	The statement is supported by the table. North Melbourne recorded a home score of 9.14 (68) in their match against St Kilda at Arden Street Oval on June 3, 1961, while South Melbourne recorded a home score of 7.8 (50) in their match against Fitzroy at Lake Oval on the same date.
874	Supported. The table shows that the crowd at Lake Oval for the South Melbourne vs Fitzroy game on 3 June 1961 was 14,500, while the crowd at Glenferrie Oval for the Hawthorn vs Richmond game on the same day was 15,000. Thus, the statement that the Lake Oval venue recorded a lower crowd of participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue is supported by the table.
875	The statement is refuted by the table as the Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 13,000 while Glenferrie Oval had a crowd of 15,000 during the 1961 VFL season. Therefore, the Arden Street Oval had 2,000 more crowds than Glenferrie Oval, not the other way around.
876	The statement you provided is refuted by the table. While the table does show a match that was played at Lake Oval, the match only had a crowd of 14,500, which is not the highest attendance recorded during the 1961 VFL season. The highest recorded attendance is shown in the Melbourne vs Carlton game at the MCG, which had a crowd of 49,678, far exceeding the Lake Oval attendance.
877	The statement is supported by the table. "Kardinia Park" is listed as the venue for the match between "Geelong" and "Footscray" on "3 June 1961". Therefore, it can be concluded that Kardinia Park was one of the four venues that were put to use on that day, as stated in the statement.
878	The statement is incorrect. According to the provided table, North Melbourne had a home score of 9.14 (68) while St Kilda had an away score of 11.16 (82). South Melbourne had a home score of 7.8 (50) while Fitzroy had an away score of 17.15 (117). Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
879	The statement is supported by the table. The "Lake Oval" venue recorded a crowd of 14,500 while the "Glenferrie Oval" venue recorded a crowd of 15,000 on June 3, 1961. Therefore, the attendance at Glenferrie Oval was lower than that of Lake Oval.
880	The statement is refuted by the table. The Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 13,000 during the North Melbourne vs St Kilda match, while the Glenferrie Oval had a crowd of 15,000 during the Hawthorn vs Richmond match. Therefore, the Glenferrie Oval only had 2,000 more crowd participants than the Arden Street Oval.
881	The statement "there are only two highest ranks listed in the table" is not supported by the provided table. The table lists four different highest ranks achieved by the sumo wrestlers: sekiwake, ōzeki, and two different wrestlers achieved a highest rank of ōzeki. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
882	Supported. According to the provided table, Takamiyama's first record was in November 1969 and his last record was in September 1982. This time range is a span of 13 years, supporting the statement that Takamiyama had the longest time range between his first and last record.
883	Supported. The only total that appears more than two times in the given table is 22, which appears for three different sumo wrestlers.
884	The statement is supported by the table. Row 5 states that Hasegawa held the record of 30 sumo victories between November 1965 and September 1974. Therefore, the first record of sumo victories was indeed recorded in November of the year 1965.
885	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table as it does not include information about the highest or lowest totalling name.
886	The statement is not supported by the table as there are four different highest ranks listed in the table which are sekiwake, ōzeki, komusubi and yokozuna.
887	Supported. Based on the given table, Takamiyama had his first sumo record in November 1969 and his last one in September 1982, which means he held sumo records for a total of 13 years, making him the wrestler with the shortest time range between his first and last record among the wrestlers listed in the table.
888	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that the total of 31 appears twice: once for Musōyama and once for Hasegawa. No other total appears more than two times in the table provided. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
889	The statement is supported by the table since the earliest record listed in the table for total sumo wins is from November 1965, which is Hasegawa with 30 wins.
890	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table because it does not include the months in which the sumo records were achieved. The table only includes the following information: name, total number of wins, first record, last record, and highest rank achieved.
891	The statement is supported by the table. The table lists the Equestrian at the Asian Games events from 1982 to 2010, and there is no entry for 1990, indicating that there was no Equestrian at the Asian Games event that year.
892	The statement is refuted by the provided table as the location of the equestrian event was not located in a different city every year. For instance, the equestrian event was held in New Delhi in 1982, while in 1986 it was held in Seoul which is not a different city but in the same country as the previous event. Similarly, in 1994 it was held in Hiroshima, which is also in the same country as the 1986 event. Therefore, it can be concluded that the location of the equestrian event was not different every year it was held at the Asian Games.
893	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Nadia Al-Moutawakel won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games in 1982, which was the first time equestrian was included in the Asian Games.
894	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that for each year listed, a different athlete/team won the gold medal for equestrian at the Asian Games. Therefore, the statement that "the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year they have occurred" is supported by the provided table.
895	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that equestrian events were held in South Korea in 1986 (Seoul) and 2006 (Doha). Although Incheon also hosted the equestrian events during the 2014 Asian Games, it is not included in this particular table.
896	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that equestrian events were held in every edition of the Asian Games from 1982 to 2010, which is a span of 8 editions, with a gap between 1990 and 1994. This means that equestrian competitions had a four-year interval between 1982 and 2010.
897	The statement is supported by the table. Each row shows the year and location of the equestrian event at the Asian Games, and it can be seen from the table that the location changes every year, except for 1994 and 1998. In 1994, the equestrian event was held in Hiroshima, Japan, and then again in Bangkok, Thailand in 1998.
898	Supported. According to the table, in the year 1982 held in New Delhi, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games. In other years, she did not win gold, but the table shows that Nadia Al-Moutawaa won the silver medal in equestrian at the Asian Games in the same year (1982) where she won the gold medal. So, Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and also win the silver medal a different year.
899	The statement is supported by the table as the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year they have occurred except for 1994 and 1998, where Konoshin Kuwahara and Jin Kanno respectively won the gold medal in both years.
900	The statement "South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time, in Seoul two times" is supported by the table. Equestrian was held twice in Seoul according to the table in the years 1986 and 2002.
901	The statement "the 49ers won eight of the games in the 1947 season" is supported by the table. The 49ers had a total of 14 games in the 1947 season with a record of 8-4-2. They won 8 games as shown in the "result" column where the letter "W" is present.
902	Supported. The table shows that the 49ers' first opponent of the 1947 season was the Brooklyn Dodgers in week 1 on August 31, 1947, which the 49ers won with a score of 23-7.
903	Supported. According to the provided table, the first row indicates that the first game of the season was played on August 31, 1947, and the San Francisco 49ers won the game against the Brooklyn Dodgers with a score of 23-7. Therefore, the statement "August 31st 1947 was the date of the first game of the season" is supported by the table.
904	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the 49ers had two tied games during the 1947 season, one against the Baltimore Colts in Week 6 and another against the Buffalo Bills in Week 14.
905	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that the San Francisco 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons on Week 2 and Week 9 of the 1947 season, resulting in two wins for the 49ers.
906	The statement is refuted by the table. In the 1947 season, the 49ers played a total of 14 games and lost only four of them, while winning eight and tying two.
907	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table as it only includes the results of the first 14 games of the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season and does not cover the last game of the season.
908	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season continued after August 31st with games played in September, October, November, and December.
909	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows the 49ers lost three out of fourteen games in the 1947 season, specifically in weeks 4, 8, and 11.
910	The statement is not supported by the table. The San Francisco 49ers played against the Los Angeles Dons two times in the 1947 season, once on September 7th and once on November 2nd.
911	The statement is not supported by the table. Annika Sorenstam won the Women's British Open in 2003 with a score of 278 and Yani Tseng won in 2010 with a score of 277. However, Jeong Jang had the lowest number of strokes in this list, having won the championship in 2005 with a score of 272.

916	The statement is not supported by the table. Annika Sörenstam won the Women's British Open in 2003 with a score of 278 strokes, which is not the lowest score in the table. However, Catriona Matthew won the Women's British Open in 2009 with a score of 285 strokes, which is not the lowest score in the table either.
917	The statement is refuted by the table. Karrie Webb did not finish as a runner-up in 2008 Women's British Open. Also, while Webb won the championship in 2010, she was not the champion in 2011 as it was won by Yani Tseng.
918	Supported. According to the table, Se Ri Pak from South Korea won the Women's British Open in 2001 with a score of 277 and a margin of victory of two strokes.

921	Supported. According to the provided table, the Dolphins won 12 games and lost 4 during the regular season in 1983.
922	Supported. Looking at the table, we can see that the Miami Dolphins played 16 games during the 1983 season, and two of those games resulted in shutouts, meaning their defense prevented the opposing team from scoring any points. These shutouts are the 1st game against the Buffalo Bills, which they won 12-0, and the 12th game against the Baltimore Colts, which they won 37-0.
923	The statement is supported by the table. The provided table shows that the Miami Dolphins won 9 out of their last 10 games in the 1983 season.

927	The statement is refuted by the table. While the Miami Dolphins had an impressive 12-4 regular season record in 1983, their final 10 games were not all victories. From Week 7 to Week 11, they had a mixed record of 3 wins and 2 losses. Overall, they won 9 out of their final 10 games in the regular season.
928	This statement is refuted by the table. The Dolphins scored more than 34 points in three different games during the 1983 season: - Week 2: Dolphins vs. Patriots; Dolphins won 34-24- Week 7: Dolphins vs. Jets; Dolphins won 32-14- Week 13: Dolphins vs. Bengals; Dolphins won 38-14 Therefore, the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game during the 1983 season was 38 points.

931	The statement is partially correct. The score was 2-1 on February 10 when Minnesota played against St. Louis, however, on February 24, Minnesota played against Calgary, and the score was 2-1 in favor of Calgary, not Minnesota. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
932	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table provided as the two matches mentioned in the statement, February 12 and February 20, had different decisions according to the table (Harding and Backstrom were the winning goaltenders respectively).
933	The provided table does not provide information about the number of home and away games played by the Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season, so the statement cannot be confirmed or refuted using the table.
934	The statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "decision" column, "Backstrom" appears 11 times more than "Harding." Specifically, "Backstrom" appears 8 times, while "Harding" appears only 3 times.
935	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Minnesota Wild won both games on February 27 and February 29 during the 2007-08 season with scores of 3-2 against Tampa Bay and Florida respectively. Therefore, the statement that the Minnesota Wild lost by more than 2 is incorrect.
936	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table since it only includes the scores and game results for each of the listed dates. It does not provide the score difference for each game.
937	The statement is refuted by the provided table. The match on February 12 had a score of 2-4, whereas the match on February 20 had a score of 0-3. Hence, the scores of both matches were not the same.

948	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as the table only shows the scores and results of the 1976 Detroit Lions season, and the highest score shown is 41 points. It is possible that the Lions scored 58 points in a game during the 1976 season, but this information is not provided in the table.
949	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, the Lions beat the Packers 27-6 in their Week 8 matchup on October 31, 1976. Therefore, the statement that the Packers scored the highest amount of points (6) in a game versus the Lions is not supported by the table.
950	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Kentucky Wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in four games, specifically in their games against Cincinnati, Xavier, Georgia, and Vanderbilt.
951	The statement is supported by the table, as we can see that in the two games that the Wildcats lost, against Ole Miss on September 20th and against Alabama on November 1st, they only scored 7 and 0 points, respectively. In all other games, which they won, they scored 20, 20, 26, 14, 7, 15, 36, and 6 points, respectively.

953	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the Kentucky Wildcats played two games in September (Sept. 20 and Sept. 27), four games in October (Oct. 4, Oct. 11, Oct. 18, and Oct. 25), and four games in November (Nov. 1, Nov. 8, Nov. 15, and Nov. 22).

957	The statement is partly supported by the table. The table shows that the Wildcat lost one game in September against Ole Miss and lost one game in November against Tennessee. However, the table does not show the second loss in September. Therefore, the statement is only partially supported by the table.
958	The statement is supported by the table. The Wildcats played one game in September (on September 20), three games in October (on October 4, 11, and 18), and four games in November (on November 1, 8, 15, and 22).

961	The statement "the issue affecting time engine trouble is the most common" cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table. The table only provides information about the drivers, constructors, laps completed, finishing times, and starting positions for the 1971 South African Grand Prix. It does not provide any information about the reasons for the retirements or the frequency of engine trouble.
962	This statement is supported by the table provided. Alex Soler-Roig is listed in the last row of the table with the highest grid position of 25, followed by Howden Ganley in the 24th position, and Jackie Stewart in the first grid position.
963	The statement is not supported by the table as there is no driver or constructor in the table who completed only 5 laps. However, the statement about a four-way tie for the most laps at 79 is supported by the table.
964	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as all drivers in the table have completed at least 75 laps.
965	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table. There are a total of six different constructors shown in the table, with no indication of the total number of entries by each constructer. Additionally, the table only shows the results of the top 26 drivers, meaning that there may have been additional entries by each constructor that are not shown in the table. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if any one constructor was the most or least represented based on the provided table.
966	The provided table does not provide any information about the frequency or commonality of suspension troubles in the 1971 South African Grand Prix. Therefore, it is not possible to support or refute the statement using the given table.
967	The statement is false. The highest position on the grid in the provided table is 24, which is held by Peter Gethin. John Love starts in the 22nd position and Howden Ganley starts in the 24th position, while Dave Charlton starts in the 16th position. Therefore, the statement that John Love has the highest position on the grid following Howden Ganley at 16 with Dave Charlton in the 1st position is refuted by the provided table.
968	The statement is not supported by the table. There are no drivers listed who completed 75 laps or fewer. The driver who completed the fewest number of laps is Jo Bonnier who completed only 5 laps. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
969	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as all the drivers completed at least 75 laps in the 1971 South African Grand Prix. Therefore, all drivers have their respective times/reasons for retirement listed in the table. The driver who completed the least number of laps, Peter Gethin, completed 7 laps before retiring due to a fuel leak.
970	Supported. The table shows that "team brazil" is listed as the only football club located on the South American continent. Additionally, no other football clubs on the table are listed as being located on the South American continent. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
971	The statement is supported by the table. We can see in row 14 that "team australia" is listed as belonging to the continent "oceania" while no other club in the table is associated with this continent. Therefore, "team australia" is the only football club located in Oceania in the given table.

985	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Carlos Brito was the head coach of Rio Ave in the 2004-05 Primeira Liga season, but Sporting CP's head coach was José Peseiro during the same season. Therefore, Carlos Brito was not the head coach of both clubs in that season.
986	The statement is refuted by the table. Belenenses, the team that finished 15th in the Liga of the 2003-2004 season, played at Estádio do Restelo, while the team that finished 2nd in the Liga, Benfica, played at Estádio da Luz, not at Estádio cidade de Coimbra.
987	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that José Couceiro was the head coach of Vitória de Setúbal, and Manuel Machado was the head coach of Vitória de Guimarães, which is a city in Portugal. Therefore, the statement is correct.
988	The statement is not supported by the provided table. The table shows that Porto was 1st in the liga for the 2004-05 season, not the 2003-04 season, and that Benfica was 2nd, not from the city of Porto but from Lisbon.

991	Supported. The table shows that all the characters listed as alive after exiting the cube are male: Kazan, an autistic savant played by Andrew Miller, and he exited from the Kazan prison in Russia.
992	The statement is supported by the table since only one female character "Joan Leaven" had a prison connection in the USA (Leavenworth prison).
993	Supported. According to the table provided, Quentin is the only character who is explicitly stated to be a police officer ("occupation" column) and his "prison connection" is listed as San Quentin State Prison in the USA. None of the other characters have "police officer" listed as their occupation. Therefore, the statement that Quentin is the only person to be a police officer in the cube is supported by the table.
994	Supported. The only person listed as a prison escapist is Rennes, and their status is listed as dead in the table.
995	The statement is incorrect. Only one female character, Joan Leaven, was present in the cube, and she did not make it out alive. Therefore, the table refutes the statement.
996	The statement is refuted by the provided table. While there is a female character named Joan Leaven listed in the table, her status is listed as "dead" after exiting the Cube. Only Kazan, a male character, is listed as alive after exiting the Cube.
997	The given statement is unsupported by the provided table. Only one female character, Dr. Helen Holloway, had a prison connection in the UK. Joan Leaven, the mathematics student, had a prison connection in the USA, specifically at Leavenworth prison.
998	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Quentin was a police officer and that he was connected to the San Quentin State Prison in the USA.
999	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that only one person, Rennes, was a prison escapist and he died while in the cube.

1001	Supported. There are three episodes with titles that begin with the letter "t" in the provided table: 1. "Tia & Tamera Mowry / LL Cool J"2. "Tony! Toni! Tone!"3. "Three episodes have titles beginning with the letter t." (this is not listed in the table, but it confirms the statement)
1002	The statement cannot be verified as there is no information in the table about the Nick production numbers being sequential. While it is true that the "Aaliyah" episode was aired after the episode with Nick production number 353 (which is one number higher than the Nick production number of the "Aaliyah" episode), we cannot determine from the table whether there were any other episodes in between them with a higher Nick production number. Therefore, the statement remains unverified.
1003	The statement is refuted by the table. None of the episode titles in the table consist entirely of numbers.
1004	The statement is supported by the table as the episode with series 47 ( Chris Farley / Mint Condition) aired on January 11, 1997, and the episode with season 2 (Montell Jordan) aired on November 23, 1996.

The closest episodes to January in season 10 were on December 12, 1998, and February 6, 1999. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1010	The statement is supported by the table. In the "Mountains classification" column of the table, it can be observed that the entry for stage 1 is "not awarded", while all of the other stages have a winner in this classification.

1011	Refuted. According to the given table, Team HTC - Columbia had the most team classification wins, with five, while Caisse d'Epargne only had one. Therefore, the statement "Caisse d'Epargne had the most team classification wins with eleven" is refuted by the provided table.

1026	The statement is partially supported by the table. The athlete Fatima Whitbread is mentioned in the table under the Javelin Throw event, but she shares the record with Trine Hattestad of Norway. The table also provides information on two different designs of javelin, where Fatima Whitbread's record of 72.18m was achieved using the old design and Trine Hattestad's record of 67.76m was achieved using the current design.
1027	The statement is supported by the table, as row 15 shows that Milcah Chemos from Kenya has a record of 9:15.06 in the 3000 m steeplechase event that was achieved on September 6th, 2013.

1031	The statement is supported by the table. Row 19 mentions Tatyana Lebedeva from Russia, who set the Memorial Van Damme record in the triple jump event, not long jump.
1032	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Tsvetanka Christova from Bulgaria holds the record for the discus throw event at the Memorial Van Damme. Fatima Whitbread from the United Kingdom and Trine Hattestad from Norway are mentioned in the table in relation to the javelin throw event.
1033	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Milcah Chemos' record in the 3000m steeplechase is 9:15.06, not more than 19:15.06.
1034	We cannot determine if the statement is true or false based on the provided table alone as the table only lists records and not the history of the 400 m event. We would need to consult additional sources to confirm or refute the statement.
1035	The statement is not supported by the table. The pole vault event was not mentioned to have taken place before August 26, 2005, in the table. It only shows that the women's pole vault world record was set by Yelena Isinbayeva from Russia on August 26, 2005, with a height of 4.93 meters.

For instance, row 43 shows that in 2014, one of the Army-Navy games was held at Air Force (not Baltimore), and row 44 notes that the locations for the 2016 game have not been determined, indicating that it's not a given that every game will be played in Baltimore. Furthermore, while the table only covers up until 2018, it's worth noting that the 2020 Army-Navy game was held at West Point, rather than in Baltimore. Therefore, while Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium is often used as a site for the Army-Navy game, the table suggests that not every game is played there, making the statement that "all but one season" has a Baltimore game potentially inaccurate.

1170	The statement is incorrect. The Dallas Cowboys played against the Seattle Seahawks on January 6th, not December 31st, and lost to the Seahawks with a final score of 21-20, not 20-9. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.

1173	The statement in the table confirms that Roger Dutton/Tony Wright received 3 points for finishing in 8th place at the 1972 Isle of Man TT.
1174	The statement is supported by the table. The fifth place in the 1972 Isle of Man TT was won by Barry Dungworth and R.W. Turrington riding a BMW with a speed of 82.32 mph.
1175	The statement is true. Roger Dutton and Tony Wright received 3 points, which is the second-lowest points received on the table.
1176	The statement is refuted by the table. The BMW in row 5 had a speed of 82.32 mph but it actually received 6 points.
1177	This statement is not supported by the table. In fact, looking at the table we can see that César Ramos only won races for two different teams during his career: BVM - Target Racing (in the Italian Formula Three Championship in 2010) and BVM Minardi Team (in the Formula Renault 2.0 Italy - Winter Series in 2007). All the other teams he drove for did not achieve a win during his time with them.

1181	The statement is refuted by the table. The player Vijay Singh is listed as being from Fiji, not the United States.
1182	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as the table only contains data for the top 9 players of the 2007 FedEx Cup playoffs and none of the players have 56 events listed.

1187	The statement is supported by the table. The first row of the table lists "cai" as the state, "sovereign" as the type of leadership, "yi" as the name of the leader, "marquis" as the title, "ji" as the royal house, and "837 BC" as the starting year. Therefore, we can conclude that the name "Yi" is associated with the royal house "Ji" and the state "Cai" during the 820s BC.
1188	The statement is supported by the table. In row 9 of the table, Jin is the state name, and Xi is the name of the sovereign with the title of Marquis. In row 10, Jin is the state name again, but this time Xian is the name of the sovereign with the title of Marquis. Therefore, it can be concluded that Xi or Xian is the name used for the sovereign when the state name is Jin and the title is Duke. However, there are no dukes listed for the state of Jin in this particular table.
1189	The statement is refuted by the table. The name "Yi" is associated with the state of Cai and the royal house of Ji, but the year listed for Yi in the table is 837 BC, not 826 BC. Additionally, the entry for Cai in the year 826 BC is for a different ruler named Dai, not Yi.

1195	The statement is refuted by the table. In game 4, where Austin Daye scored 16 points, he was not the player with the most rebounds. Instead, Ben Wallace and Jason Maxiell both had 8 rebounds during that game. Therefore, the record of 2 - 4 is not associated with Austin Daye recording the highest number of rebounds for the team in any game.
1196	The statement is refuted by the table. Ben Gordon had 5 rebounds in the game in which he scored 17 points, while Rodney Stuckey had 5 assists. It was a different game (the first game of the season) in which Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva had 5 rebounds, while Rodney Stuckey did score 16 points.
1197	The statement is refuted by the table. The game in which Austin Daye scored the lowest number of points was against the Minnesota Timberwolves (Oct. 15), where he scored 18 points.

1375	The statement cannot be fully supported by the table as there were some districts where the Democratic incumbent ran unopposed and therefore not subject to an election (e.g., California 7) while other Democratic incumbents were challenged by candidates from other parties, though they ultimately prevailed (e.g., California 17). Additionally, a new district (California 22) was created and won by a Republican candidate. Therefore, the statement that "in all elections where the Democrat held the seat, the party maintained the office" is not accurate based on the information presented in the table.
1376	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 6 of the table, Alfred J Elliott ran unopposed and was re-elected in California's 10th district in 1942.

Therefore, the statement cannot be verified using the given table.
1381	The statement is incorrect. The table does not have a row where there is only one party with candidates being harry lane englebright (r) and n e west (d). This statement contains an error where it references the incorrect row and also combines the results of two different districts.

1382	The statement cannot be verified or refuted by the provided table, as it only lists the results of the United States House of Representatives elections in California in 1942. It does not provide information about the first election of any party, except for Thomas Rolph of California's 4th district, who was first elected in 1940 and was re-elected in 1942 as a Republican.
1383	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, John H. Tolan was the Democratic incumbent for the California 7th district and he was re-elected in 1942.

1427	The statement is supported by the table. Row 12 of the table states that the episode titled "The Maze" was directed by Jeremy Summers and written by Tony O'Grady, who is actually a pseudonym used by Brian Clemens. Therefore, John Moxey did not direct the episode written by Tony O'Grady.
1428	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the given table, the production number for episode 23 is 124.
1429	The statement is supported by the table. "There's Somebody Close Behind You" is listed in row 15 with a filmed date of Jul / Aug 1966.
1430	Supported. The second row in the table shows that the driver Lorenzo Bandini, racing for Ferrari, completed 105 laps and had a time / retired of 2:06:18.23, which is equivalent to +6.18 in terms of time behind the first-place driver.

1432	The statement "the cdr for the period 1975 - 1980 is 9.0 and the life expectancy is 61.5" is supported by the provided table. The relevant data is found in row 7, where the cdr for the period 1975 - 1980 is indeed 9.0 and the life expectancy is 61.5.
1433	The statement is supported by the table. The row for the period 1995-2000 shows that the infant mortality rate (IMR) is 34 and the life expectancy at birth is 69.3, for both males and females.
1434	Yes, the statement is supported by the table. In row 10 (1990-1995), the cbr (Crude Birth Rate) was 22.6 and the number of deaths per year was 1,058,000.
1435	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, in the period of 1965-1970, the number of live births per year was 3,330,000 and the number of deaths per year was 998,000.
1436	The statement "in the period 2000 - 2005, there was a tfr of 2.25 and an nc of 13.4" is supported by the provided table. The entry in row 12 for the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is indeed 2.25, and the entry for Natural Change (NC) is 13.4.
1437	The statement is supported by the table. The period where the life expectancy for females was 73.3 is 1995-2000, and the corresponding number of live births per year is 3,624,000.
1438	The statement is refuted by the table. The total life expectancy in 1950 - 1955 is 50.9, which is less than 70.1. The cdr in 1950 - 1955 is 15.5, which is also less than 32.5.
1439	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the life expectancy total in 1995-2000 is 69.3, which is greater than 61.5. Also, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in 1995-2000 is 34, which is not equal to 27. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1440	The statement is supported by the table. In the row where "deaths per year" is 1,058,000, the "cdr" or Crude Death Rate is 6.5 and the "imr" or Infant Mortality Rate is 34. Therefore, in the mentioned period, the "cdr" is not equal to 22.6, it is 6.5.
1441	The statement is refuted by the provided table. In the period where there were 900,000 deaths per year (1950-1955), the natural change per year was 1,672,000, not 2,500,000.
1442	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the period where the tfr was 2.45 was 1995-2000, and the corresponding imr was 43. Therefore, there was a tfr of 2.45 in the period where the imr was 43.
1443	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that there were 3 441 000 live births per year in the period from 1975 to 1980.
1444	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it contains errors in its logical construction. The statement includes a requirement of a "cultural and educational panel smaller than 0", which is not a valid criteria, as the number of members in a panel cannot be negative. Also, there are no values in the table for an "industrial and commercial panel greater than 1", which makes it impossible to determine whether the rest of the criteria are met.
1445	Supported. According to the table, Jose Ortiz was a center for the Utah Jazz from 1988-90 and played for Oregon State, which supports the statement.
1446	The statement "andre owens was the Houston Jazz club guard from 2005 - 06" is not supported by the provided table. The table lists Andre Owens as a guard who played for the Utah Jazz from 2005-06. There is no mention of any connection to the Houston Jazz club. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1447	The table provided does not support or refute the statement about a Jazz club in Houston during the 2005-06 school year as it only provides information about the Utah Jazz all-time roster, and does not mention any information about a Jazz club in Houston.
1448	The statement is supported by the provided table. Row 5 of the table lists Dan O'Sullivan as a United States player who played center for the Utah Jazz in 1990-1991 and attended Fordham University.
1449	The statement is supported by the table. Row 4 states that Greg Ostertag, a United States national, played the center position for the Jazz from 1995-2004 and then again from 2005-2006.
1450	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, under "player", the fourth row lists "Greg Ostertag". Under "nationality", it listed "United States". Under "position", it listed "Center". And under "school/club team", it indeed listed "Kansas". Therefore, the statement that "Greg Ostertag played center and went to Kansas" is supported by the table.
1451	The statement is refuted by the table as it mentions that Greg Ostertag, a center from the United States, played for the Jazz from 1995-2004, and then again in 2005-06. The table also does not mention anything about Ostertag attending Oregon State University. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
1452	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Andre Owens played as a guard for the Utah Jazz from 2005-06, and not as a center.
1453	The statement is partially supported by the table. The table shows that the Utah Jazz had a player named Andre Owens, who was a guard and played for them from 2005-06. However, he did not graduate from Houston. The table does show that the Utah Jazz had a player from Turkey named Mehmet Okur who played for them from 2004-11 and graduated from Efes Pilsen (Turkey).
1454	The statement is not supported by the table. The table states that Dan O'Sullivan attended Fordham University and played the center position for the Utah Jazz during the 1990-91 season.
1455	The statement is supported by the table. The player Mehmet Okur, whose club team was Efes Pilsen in Turkey, is listed under the position "forward-center". Since the position listed includes center, it can be concluded that the position "center" was part of Okur's playing time with Efes Pilsen.
1456	Refuted. The only season with a GB of 5 in the table is 2010, which had a win percentage of .535. However, there are other seasons with different GB values that have win percentages both higher and lower than .535, which makes it impossible for the average win percentage of a season with a GB of 5 to be exactly .535.
1457	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table, as none of the seasons listed in the table had a gb (games back) value of exactly 5.
1458	This statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the provided table as it does not include information solely based on seasons without a gb of 5. The table includes information for all seasons from 1978-2013 for the Nashville Sounds, including those with a gb of 5. Additionally, the statement does not provide any context for how the win percentage was calculated or what time frame it is referring to.
1459	The table does not support this statement as there is no row in the table that shows a gb of 5 and a win percentage of 0.535. Additionally, it is not possible to calculate the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5 using this table as there are multiple rows with different win percentages and gb values.
1460	The statement is supported by the table. In row 5 of the table, under the "Incumbent" column, it states "Sidney R Yates", and under the "First Elected" column, it states "1964". This shows that Sidney R Yates was first elected to the Illinois 9th District in 1964.
1461	The statement is not supported by the provided table. The table does not mention Sidney R. Yates as the incumbent from the Republican Party in Illinois' 10th district in 1964. The table only shows that Sidney R. Yates was elected as the incumbent representative from Illinois' 9th district as a Democrat in 1964 and he was re-elected in the same district in 1974.
1462	The statement is supported by the table. Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, and she won with a score of 6-7 (5) 6-1 6-7 (5).
1463	The statement is supported by the table. The first row of the table shows that on 2 May 1999, Leanne Baker won a match against Candice Jairala in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico on a hard surface.
1464	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Leanne Baker was the runner-up in the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on a hard surface, but her opponent in that final was Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperová.
1465	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the outcome on 2 May 1999 was "winner", the location was "Coatzacoalcos, Mexico", the surface was "hard", and the opponent in the final was "Candice Jairala". Thus, the surface was not grass on 2 May 1999.
1466	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "Volume 5" had "4 episodes" and was released in "Region 1" on "September 19, 2006".
1467	The statement is refuted by the table. We can see from the table that there are multiple volumes that have more than 1 disc, such as volume 2, 3, 4, and 5.
1468	Supported. Looking at the table provided, we can see that the 5th volume was released in region 1 on September 19, 2006, and there were 4 episodes in that volume.
1469	The statement is refuted by the table, as it shows that for each volume or season, there is exactly one disc.
1470	Supported. According to the table, row 1 lists the header of each column, including the "region 4" column. In row 2, under the "region 4" column, it shows that on March 15, 2007, there were 4 episodes. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1471	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table as there is no information given about a specific DVD release in region 4 on March 13, 2008. The table only provides general information about the volume number, number of discs, number of episodes, and release dates in different regions for a TV series.
1472	The statement is refuted by the table as Volume 5 has a region 1 release date of September 19, 2006, while the region 1 release date of May 30, 2006 is for Volume 3. Therefore, the volume that has 1 disc, 4 episodes, and a region 1 release date of May 30, 2006, is Volume 3.
1473	The statement is not supported by the table. The table states that each volume has only one disc, and each volume has four episodes. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1474	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only contains information about the release dates of DVDs for a certain TV series and does not provide any information about the air dates of episodes in different regions.
1475	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the provided table as all episodes in each row are listed under a single "discs" column with a value of 1. The table only displays the release date of each volume and the corresponding regions.
1476	The statement is refuted by the table. On March 15, 2007, in region 2, the number of episodes for the available volume was 1 and not 3. The table shows that the highest number of episodes available for any single volume in all regions is 4.
1477	The statement is supported by the table, as it shows the record for VCU Rams Men's Basketball team in the year 1996 as 24-9 and they participated in the Southeast region.
1478	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that in 2012, the team had a record of 29-7 and in 2013, they had a record of 27-9. However, the table does not provide any information about "the highest score", so it cannot be verified based on the table alone.
1479	The statement is supported by the table. In 2011, VCU Rams men's basketball team played in the southwest region and won a total of 5 games and lost 1 game, resulting in a record of 28-12.
1480	Supported. According to the table, in 1980, the VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 18-12 and a seed of 12 in the east region. Their result in that region was a loss of 72-86. Additionally, the year 1980 is smaller than 1996.
1481	Supported. The table shows that in the year 1980, the VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 18 - 12, which is the earliest year with a record of 18 - 12 shown in the table.
1482	The statement is actually incorrect as the best record listed in the table is 28-12 in 2011, when they received an 11 seed and even advanced to the Final Four. While VCU did have a 29-7 record in 2012, they received a 12 seed that year.
1483	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that in 2011, the VCU Rams men's basketball team won five games in a row with the following scores: 59-46, 74-56, 94-76, 72-71 (in overtime), and 71-61. These wins led to a record of 27-9.
1484	The statement is refuted by the table. The row corresponding to the year 1980 has a record of 18-12, a seed of 12, and a result of l 72 - 86. Therefore, the result l 72 - 86 satisfies the seed requirement of being less than 12, but the year requirement of being larger than 1996 is not satisfied since 1980 is before 1996.
1485	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, in 1980, VCU finished with a record of 18 - 12, but they received the 12th seed, not the 11th seed.
1486	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, in 1996, VCU Rams Men's basketball team was the 12th seed of the southeast region, and they lost to the 5th seed, Wake Forest, in the opening round of the tournament by a score of 51-58.
1487	The statement is supported by the table. Row 2 of the table states that David Duchovny won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series in 1996 for his role as Fox Mulder in The X-Files.
1488	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that in 1997, David Duchovny was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series for his role as David Duchovny in The X-Files.
1489	The statement is partially supported by the table. The earliest year when the role/episode is "Fox Mulder" is 1996, but the result for this category is "won," not "nominated." Therefore, the statement is partially true but needs to be revised.
1490	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, the role / episode is not mentioned in any of the rows as "David Duchovny" in 1998. The only reference to David Duchovny in the table is in the "best actor in a leading role - drama series" category in 1997. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.
1491	Supported. Based on the table provided, Zoë Wanamaker plays the character Ariadne Oliver in episodes 10 to 13 from 2006 to 2013.
1492	The statement is refuted by the table. The actor of the character "Ariadne Oliver" is Zoë Wanamaker, as listed in row 6 of the table. Hugh Fraser played the character "Arthur Hastings", as listed in row 3 of the table.

According to the table, the incumbent candidate, Goodloe Byron, was re-elected in Maryland District 6 with 73.7% of the votes, defeating the Republican candidate, Elton R. Wampler, who received 26.3% of the votes. Therefore, Elton R. Wampler did not succeed Goodloe Byron in that election.
1502	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, Thomas J Hatem was the Democratic candidate and the challenger to the incumbent Robert Bauman, a Republican, during the 1974 election for Maryland's 1st congressional district. However, Robert Bauman was re-elected as the representative of that district.
1503	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as there is no row for Maryland's 8th congressional district, and Parren Mitchell does not appear in any of the rows in the provided table. The table only includes data for Maryland's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th congressional districts.
1504	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the candidates for Maryland District 7 were incumbent Parren Mitchell who ran unopposed. Goodloe Byron and Elton R Wampler were the candidates for Maryland District 6.
1505	The statement is not supported by the table. Robert Bauman is not listed as the incumbent of Maryland District 2 in the table. He is listed as the incumbent of Maryland District 1 and is shown as being re-elected for that district in the 1974 United States House of Representatives elections.
1506	The statement is false. The table shows that Robert Bauman is the Republican incumbent for Maryland District 1, not District 7, and he was re-elected in 1974. Bauman belongs to the Republican Party, not the Democratic Party. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1507	This statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland District 7, but he was unopposed and did not defeat Elton R. Wampler or any other candidate.

1514	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Hamburg and Standard Liège played against each other in the 2009-10 Europa League, Standard Liège was not listed as team 1 in the table. In fact, they played against Panathinaikos in the round of 32 while Hamburg played against Anderlecht.
1515	The statement cannot be determined from the provided table as the 2nd leg score for the match with team 2 of Werder Bremen is not specified in the table. It only shows that Werder Bremen drew 4-4 with Valencia in the 2nd leg, but it does not provide the 1st leg score, so it cannot be determined whether the 2nd leg score is less than the 1st leg score.
1516	The statement is refuted by the table. The score 1 - 3 in the first leg corresponds to the match between Lille and Liverpool, not Panathinaikos and Liverpool. The first leg score for Panathinaikos vs. Standard Liège was 1 - 3.

1522	The statement cannot be directly supported or refuted by the table as it does not include a time of 6:40.02. However, it can be inferred that rank 4, which is Hungary with a time of 6:50.48, did not achieve a time lower than 6:40.02 as that time is not present in the table. Therefore, the statement is supported indirectly by the table.

1546	The statement is refuted by the table. Herb Estes has a total of 734 rebounds, not 708.
1547	The statement is refuted by the table. While Jesse Young has a rank of 10 and played over 124 games, his rebound average is only 6.2, which is not the total of rebound averages meeting these criteria.
1548	The statement is supported by the table as row 13 shows that Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24 with a score of 108-111 in overtime.
1549	The statement is refuted by the table. The result of the game on November 20 in Dallas was a loss for the Toronto Raptors with a score of 99-105 (OT).
1550	Supported. The table shows that on July 9, 1990, Isabel Cueto played against Barbara Paulus in the final and won 6-2, 6-3. Therefore, the statement that "the opponent in the final on July 9, 1990 was Barbara Paulus" is supported by the table.

1552	The statement is supported by the table. In the tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria on July 31, 1989, Isabel Cueto won the final against Katerina Maleeva with a score of 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 (3).
1553	The statement is refuted by the table. The date given for the match against Barbara Paulus was 9 July 1990, and the opponent listed for that match was Barbara Paulus, not Katerina Maleeva.

1555	The statement is supported by the table. The teams with 3 losses, Montreal Hockey Club, Ottawa Hockey Club, and Montreal Victorias, all have 0 ties as shown in the "ties" column where their respective values are 0.
1556	The statement is incorrect. The game against the opponent Buffalo Sabres had an attendance of 15611, as shown in row 12 of the provided table.
1557	The statement cannot be verified from the provided table as it only includes information on the episode title, production information, and viewer ratings. It does not list the writer and director for each episode.
1558	The statement is supported by the table. The row with production code "2arg01" corresponds to the episode titled "Earthquake", which was originally aired on October 6, 2010. Therefore, the episode with the production code of 2arg01 was indeed originally aired on October 6, 2010, as stated in the statement.
1559	The statement is supported by the table. "Halloween" is the title of the 6th episode of Modern Family's season 2, and its production code is 2arg09.
1560	Supported. According to the table, the episode with the production code of 2arg24 is "See You Next Fall" and it was originally aired on May 18, 2011.

1562	The statement is refuted by the table. The episode with production code 2arg24 (See You Next Fall) was directed by Steven Levitan, not Michael Spiller.
1563	The statement is not supported by the table. Based on the table provided, the production code for the episode "See You Next Fall" is 2arg24, not 2arg01.
1564	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table alone as there are no values in the "wins" column for Chris DiMarco. However, looking at the table, it appears that Chris DiMarco has never won any of the tournaments listed (Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship or PGA Championship). Additionally, the table shows that Chris DiMarco has had at least 3 top-5 finishes and 6 top-10 finishes in these tournaments. Therefore, based on the table, the statement is neither fully supported nor fully refuted.
1565	The statement is refuted by the provided table. Looking at the row for PGA Championship in the table, when the top-25 is less than 4, the value for wins in that column is 0. The cuts made value for that row is 8, which is greater than 6, and the top-5 value is also 1 which is greater than 0. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table because the value for wins is 0 instead of 1 in the PGA Championship row.
1566	The statement is supported by the table. In the row 7, it is mentioned that "Geelong" was the home team with a score of "16.14 (110)" and "Essendon" was the away team with a score of "11.10 (76)". It can be seen that the crowd size mentioned for the match was "28158". Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1567	The statement is unsupported by the table. The table shows that the size of the crowd when Essendon was the away team was actually 28158.
1568	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table. There is no entry in the table where Hawthorn is the home team and the away team's score is 9.11 (65).
1569	The statement is supported by the table as row 7 shows a rating / share of 3.2 / 8 with a viewership of 12.42 million.
1570	The statement is supported by the table. Olimpia is indeed in position 10 and has only 2 wins according to the row "#10" in the table.
1571	The statement is supported by the table. The team positioned higher than 10 is Olimpia, who scored a total of 10 goals throughout the season, according to the "scored" column. Therefore, the statement that "the total number scored of the team positioned higher than 10 is zero" is refuted by the data in the table.

The episode with the original airdate of 8 June 2008 had 1.364 million viewers with a nightly rank of 4, which is higher than the nightly rank of the episode with the original airdate of 15 June 2008.

1579	The statement is supported by the table. Week 9 is listed on "row 10" of the table as "October 30, 1983".
1580	The statement is incorrect. Looking at the table, we can see that the date for the game against the Chicago Bears was October 16, 1983. The game on December 5, 1983, was actually against the New York Giants, and the Lions won that game 15-9.
1581	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Week 9 was played on October 23, 1983, which is before October 30, 1983.

1583	The statement is refuted by the table as the team that won in overtime with a score of 97-92 was the Miami Heat, not the Charlotte Bobcats. The Miami Heat improved to 40 - 36 after winning this game.
1584	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the given table as none of the rows state that the record was 49-36%. Therefore, there is no information in the table to support or refute the statement regarding the Verizon Center attendance.
1585	The statement is supported by the table. In row 3 of the table, it can be seen that Michael Beasley was the high scorer with 27 points, and the Miami Heat won that game against Charlotte with a score of 97-92 in overtime.
1586	The statement is supported by the table. In row 5, the table shows that Dylan Sprouse won the award for Favorite TV Actor at the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards. In row 11, the table shows that he won the same award again at the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards.

1588	The statement is refuted by the provided table as it shows that The Suite Life on Deck was nominated for the Teen Pick Show: Comedy category of the Hollywood Teen TV Awards in 2010 but did not win.

1594	The statement is partially supported by the table. The score of the match on June 8, 2012, between Kwak Tae-hwi's team and their opponent in Doha, Qatar, was indeed 2-1. However, there is no record of Kwak Tae-hwi playing a match in the 2014 World Cup Qualification campaign. Thus, the statement cannot be explicitly supported or refuted by this table.
1595	The statement is supported by the table. The game with the score of 4-1 took place on October 15, 2008, in Seoul, South Korea, as a part of the 2010 World Cup Qualification competition, and the result was 4-1. Therefore, the aggregate result of this game was 4-1.
1596	Supported. Based on the provided table, the game with a score of 3 - 2 was held in Chongqing, China on February 17, 2008 as part of the 2008 East Asian Cup.
1597	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that on February 17, 2008, in a match held in Chongqing, China, Kwak Tae-hwi's team scored 3 goals while the opposing team scored 2 goals. The result is therefore recorded as 3-2. The score, however, was not 2-0 at any point during the match.
1598	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, the score of the 2010 World Cup qualification match was 1 - 0, not 2 - 1. However, the match was held in Seoul, South Korea, which matches the statement.
1599	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the game played in London, England on March 3, 2010, had a score of 2-0 in favor of Kwak Tae-hwi's team, not 2-1. Additionally, the table does not have any game with a score of 4-1 in London. So, the statement is refuted by the table.
1600	The statement is refuted by the table. The game with a score of 3 - 2 was held in Chongqing, China on February 17, 2008, not in London. The table clearly shows the correct information regarding the venue and location of each game.

1603	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranked 3rd in terms of total cargo with 2939157 metric tonnes.

1608	The statement is supported by the table. Brian Finch's rank is 7 which is greater than 3 and his finishing time is 2:14.59.0.
1609	The statement is false. The rider Brian Finch is not part of the Suzuki team, he is part of Velocette team. Additionally, his rank is not greater than 3, he is ranked 7th. However, the time value for Brian Finch is correct, which is 2:14.59.0.
1610	The statement "series number 54 was written by m scott veach & rebecca kirsch" is partially supported by the table. The table shows that episode number 54 is titled "The Queen's Gambit Job" and was directed by Jonathan Frakes. The table also shows that the episode was written by M. Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch. Therefore, it is supported that the episode was written by Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch, but it is not correct to say that the series number (54) was written by them as it refers to the season's number, not the episode's.
1611	The statement "series number 50 has had 3.38 million viewers" is supported by the table. The entry in row 7, column 7 (US Viewers in millions) is 3.38 and the corresponding row 7, column 1 entry is 50, which refers to the episode "The Carnival Job". Therefore, the episode titled "The Carnival Job" had 3.38 million viewers.
1612	The statement is partially true. Season 1 has episodes directed by various individuals, including Dean Devlin, but not all of them are directed by him. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate to say that "season 1 is directed by Dean Devlin".
1613	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Marc Roskin directed only three episodes in the first season: "The 15 Minutes Job" (episode 3), "The Lonely Hearts Job" (episode 15), and "The Gold Job" (episode 16).
1614	The statement is refuted by the table. "The 10 Li'l Grifters Job" was actually directed by Arvin Brown and originally aired on July 3, 2011.
1615	The statement is not supported by the table as the Gold Job was directed by Marc Roskin, not Arvin Brown. Additionally, the episode was aired on January 1, 2012, and not viewed by 3.22 million viewers, rather it was viewed by 2.26 million viewers according to the table.
1616	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 4, 6, and 17 all have "na" entries for the "reader's vote" and "lifetime achievement" categories. Thus, there are three years when the reader's vote was "na" and the lifetime achievement was "na".
1617	Supported. According to the provided table, the row for the year 1998 shows "n/a" in all award categories except for "Lifetime Achievement", which has "na" written. Therefore, the statement that "in 1998, n/a won the lifetime achievement award" is supported by the table.
1618	Refuted. The table shows that the winners of the lifetime achievement award after 2005 were Andrew Rule and John Silvester in 2006, Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson in 2007, Marele Day in 2008, Shane Maloney in 2009, and Peter Doyle in 2010. No lifetime achievement award winner is listed for the years 2011 onwards. Therefore, the statement is incorrect based on the information in the table.
1619	The statement is supported by the table as there is no entry for the reader's vote in the year 2011. The "n/a" in the table indicates that there was no winner in that category for that specific year.
1620	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the only author who won the Lifetime Achievement award is Jon Cleary in 1996, Alan Yates (Carter Brown) in 1997, and then there were no winners listed for the category for the remaining years. There is no mention of any winners with "na" in the category of Lifetime Achievement after the year 1998, indicating that no one won the award in that category after 1998. Therefore, the statement that "na won the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998" is refuted by the table.
1621	The statement cannot be evaluated as the table only provides information up until the year 2011, and it is uncertain whether any of the mentioned individuals won a lifetime achievement award and whether anyone won the best non-fiction or reader's vote award after the year 2005 as the table does not provide information on those specific categories after that year.
1622	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that "na" won the reader's vote for the best teenage/young adult category in 2011, while there were no winners listed for the other categories.
1623	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table as it only provides information about the winners in different categories of the Ned Kelly Awards for years ranging from 1996 to 2011. The statement doesn't relate to any of the categories mentioned in the table.
1624	The statement is supported by the table as there is no indication under "os x" in the row for "Home Media Center".
1625	The statement "coherence has partial windows" is supported by the table. In the "coherence" row under the "Windows" column, it is indicated that Coherence has partial support for Windows.
1626	The statement is supported by the table. In the row for Rygel, the license is listed as "lgplv2".
1627	The statement is refuted by the table as it shows that the Home Media Center has support for Windows.
1628	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, under coherence, it is mentioned that Windows and Unix-like have a "Partial" OS support while the web interface has "Yes" support. Therefore, the statement "coherence is the name when windows and web interface are partial" is accurate.
1629	The statement is refuted by the table. The license for Rygel is actually LGPLv2.
1630	The statement is refuted by the table as the license for Jriver Media Center is not GPL, it is proprietary. The table clearly states that Jriver Media Center has a "prop" license, which means it is proprietary.
1631	This statement is refuted by the table as there is no mention of Bolton Wanderers playing in any of the matches listed in the table for the 1990-91 FA Cup.

1638	The statement is not supported by the table. The table does not show any match where the home team was Bolton Wanderers and the score was 1 - 0. The closest match is between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers, where Manchester United was the home team and they won 1 - 0.
1639	The statement is refuted by the table. The correct statement should be "8 was the tie no before the away team was woking".
1640	The statement is supported by the table. In the first row, under "set 3", the value for the first match on July 13th is listed as "12 - 25".
1641	The statement is supported by the table. In row 6 of the table, the set 3 score is 18-25 and the total score is 53-75.
1642	According to the given table, the statement is supported as the score 16 - 25 is recorded in row 6 which corresponds to the date 15 Jul in the first row of the table. Therefore, the Set 2 score of 16 - 25 was indeed played on 15 Jul.
1643	The statement is supported by the table. In row 4 of the table, the score for the match was 3-0 and the total score was 75-34. In set 3 of that match, the score was indeed 25-11, which matches the information stated in the statement.
1644	Supported. Looking at the table, row 5 shows that Richmond played against Melbourne at Punt Road Oval on August 21, 1943. Therefore, the statement that "at punt road oval, Richmond was Melbourne's home team opponent" is supported by the given table.
1645	The statement is supported by the table. The row 5 of the table states that Richmond played against Melbourne at Punt Road Oval, and Melbourne is listed as the away team.
1646	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Richmond was the home team with a score of 15.19 (109), while Melbourne was the away team with a score of 12.13 (85). Therefore, Richmond was not the away team opponent of Melbourne in this match.
1647	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that on 21 August 1943, Hawthorn played against South Melbourne at Glenferrie Oval, not North Melbourne. The table also does not show any match involving North Melbourne on that date.

1809	Supported. The table shows Miguel Zapata as the goalkeeper for Atlético Ciudad with an average of 0.61, which is the highest average listed for that team. Therefore, the statement "the highest average for Atlético Ciudad was 0.61" is supported by the table.
1810	The statement is supported by the table. According to the given table, Miguel Zapata scored 17 goals in 28 matches during the 2008-09 Segunda División B. Therefore, he had the fewest number of goals among the listed goalkeepers.

Alvaro Campos, on the other hand, had an average of 0.86 for Real Murcia B, which is higher than 0.61. Therefore, Alvaro Campos is not the goalkeeper for the team that had no matches with an average higher than 0.61.
1812	The statement about Miguel Zapata is NOT supported by the table. According to the table, Miguel Zapata is the goalkeeper for Atlético Ciudad, he scored 17 goals in 28 matches and has an average of 0.61. The goalkeeper with 24 goals in the table is Rubén Martínez, who plays for Cartagena and has an average of 0.75.

1819	The statement cannot be determined from the given table. The table shows the winners of each stage, as well as the general classification, points classification, mountains classification, sprints classification, and team classification overall. However, it does not provide information on what would happen if the points classification and sprints classification awards were given to different winners.
1820	The statement is supported by the table. In game 62 against Houston, the high rebounders were Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon with 7 rebounds each.

1825	The statement is refuted by the table. The visitor in Vancouver on February 24 was the New York Rangers, not Winnipeg.
1826	The statement is partially supported by the table. Season 6 has two different formats - q145 and h77.
1827	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as it only lists information for up to season 5. The table does not provide any information on whether season 6 has q245 as its format.
1828	The statement is supported by the table. The episode number 223 is listed with a format of q146, whereas the adjacent episodes, 225 and 228, have a format of q147. Therefore, 223 was the only episode with the q147 format.
1829	The statement "Anne Street has no major junctions in the milepost" is supported by the table as there is a blank space under the "Roads Intersected" and "Notes" columns for the location listed as Norfolk, Weymouth, Anne Street, indicating that there are no major junctions at that location.
1830	The statement is supported by the table. Rows 4 and 5 both have "North Avenue Plain Street Market Street" listed in the "street names" column and show mileposts of "12.2" and "12.8", respectively.
1831	Supported. According to Row 2 of the provided table, in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, Massachusetts Route 139 intersects with Route 24 at "Pleasant Street Turnpike Street Lindelof Avenue" at milepost 3.0.
1832	Supported. According to the table:- Row 4 lists Rockland under the "Location" column.- The "Milepost" for this location is listed as 12.2 under column 4.- The same location, Rockland, is listed again under row 5.- The "Milepost" for this second listing of Rockland is listed as 12.8, which confirms that 12.8 is one of the mileposts listed for the location of Rockland.
1833	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 3, Anne Street is located in Norfolk, not Plymouth, but it is true that it has no major junctions for mileposts or roads intersected.
1834	Supported. The table shows that Route 139 passes through two towns in Plymouth County: Rockland and Hanover. While the table does not mention Stoughton, it does list a location in Norfolk County (where Stoughton is located) that Route 139 passes through. Therefore, the statement is not refuted by the table.
1835	The given table does not support nor refute the statement "hanover in plymouth county intersects route 123" as there is no mention of Hanover intersecting Route 123 in the provided table.
1836	The statement "milepost 12.8 is at Weymouth" is refuted by the table for Massachusetts Route 139. According to the table, milepost 12.8 is located in Plymouth and is the eastern terminus of the concurrency between Route 123 and Route 139.
1837	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Diego Milito made his debut in 2008 and he scored 86 goals.

1839	The statement in question is supported by the table. Diego Milito is listed in row 9 of the table with a debut year of 2008 and 86 goals scored.
1840	The statement is supported by the table. The person with an all-time rank of 53 is Luca Toni and he had 258 apps.
1841	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Diego Milito made his debut in 2008 and scored 86 goals after his debut year. There are no goals listed for him before 2008.
1842	The statement is not supported by the table. There is no information in the table that indicates the total number of goals achieved specifically when Chievo made their debut after 1999. While the table shows that Sergio Pellissier, who plays for Chievo, has scored 86 goals, it does not provide any information on when those goals were scored or whether they were achieved during or after Chievo's debut year.
1843	Since the table only provides information on the number of goals and the debut year of each player, there is not enough information available to determine if the statement is true or false. The table shows that Mirko Vucinic made his debut in 2000 and has scored a total of 95 goals, but it does not provide any information about goals scored in specific debut years after 2008.
1844	The statement is supported by the table. Row 10 of the table shows that Leonardo Jardim resigned as the head coach of Beira-Mar on 28 February 2011 when his team was in the 10th position in the table.
1845	The statement is refuted by the table. In row 7 for Portimonense, the date of vacancy is listed as 28 December 2010 and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha on 29 December 2010. There is no vacancy or appointment listed for 28 December 2011 in the table.
1846	Supported. According to the table, when the team is União de Leiria, the date of appointment of the incoming head coach is 10 July 2010, as stated in row 2.
1847	This statement is not supported by the table. The latest date of vacancy in the table is on March 1, 2011, for Vitória de Setúbal, and the incoming head coach mentioned is Bruno Ribeiro, not Carlos Azenha. Therefore, the date of vacancy is not after December 28, 2011, and the incoming head coach is not Carlos Azenha, refuting the statement.
1848	That statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, União de Leiria's outgoing head coach was Lito Vidigal who was sacked on July 7, 2010. The date of vacancy is mentioned as off-season, and the incoming head coach for the team is mentioned as Pedro Caixinha and the date of appointment is mentioned as July 10, 2010. Therefore, the date of appointment for União de Leiria is on or after July 10, 2010, and not before.
1849	The statement is false. Episode no. 53 in the table is titled "Compromising Positions" and it was directed by Paul Holahan.
1850	The statement is true. The table shows that the episode directed by Robert Duncan McNeill is titled "Parting Shots" and has the production code "bcw404". Therefore, the statement "the production code for the episode directed by Robert Duncan McNeill is bcw404" is supported by the table.
1851	Supported. In the provided table, the production code "bcw410" is listed in the row corresponding to Episode 10 ("Vested Interest"). Therefore, the statement "bcw410 is the production code for episode 10" is supported by the table.
1852	The statement is supported by the table. Row 12 in the table corresponds to episode 11 titled "Family Business" and has a corresponding US viewership of 2.77 million.
1853	This statement is incorrect. The provided table shows that Paul Holahan directed an episode in Season 4 ("Wanted"), an episode in Season 5 ("Most Wanted"), an episode in Season 6 ("Compromising Positions"), and an episode in Season 7 ("Family Business"). Therefore, Paul Holahan directed episodes for Seasons 4 through 7, not just Seasons 1 through 6.
1854	The statement is refuted by the table. The production code for the episode directed by Robert Duncan McNeill is actually "bcw404", not "bcw403".
1855	The statement is supported by the table. The row 10 of the table shows that the 10th episode of the season titled "Vested Interest" had a production code of bcw410 and an air date of September 11, 2012.
1856	The statement is incorrect. Episode number 57 in the series, "Family Business," had 2.77 million U.S. viewers, not 2.75 thousand, as stated in the table.
1857	The table shows data for the Lexington Legends during the 2001-2013 seasons, including the post-season records for seasons where the team made the playoffs. However, there is no post-season record listed for the 2013 season. Therefore, the statement that "Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013" is supported by the table.
1858	This statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the Lexington Legends, who are affiliated with the Houston MLB team, had a post-season record of 4-0 and a post-season win percentage of 1.000 in the 2001 season. The table also shows that the Lexington Legends had a post-season record of 0-2 and a post-season win percentage of 0.000 in both the 2003 and 2006 seasons. Therefore, Houston did have a post-season record through its affiliate team, the Lexington Legends.
1859	Supported. Based on the information in the table, the player selected with draft pick number 155 is John Nies, a punter from Arizona University, which confirms the statement.
1860	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table as it only provides information on the draft picks made by the Buffalo Bills in the 1990 NFL Draft, and does not include information about all the colleges that participated in the draft. Therefore, we cannot conclude which college had the last draft pick based on the given table.
1861	The statement is supported by the table. "The One Where Everybody Finds Out" is listed as episode number 111 in the table.
1862	The statement is supported by the table. Episode 11, "The One with All the Resolutions", is listed in row 12 of the table with an original air date of January 7, 1999.
1863	The statement is incorrect. The production code "467663" had 24.8 million US viewers for the episode "The One with Chandler's Work Laugh". The production code "467671" had 20.9 million US viewers for the episode "The One with the Ball".
1864	The statement is not supported by the table. The "The One with All the Resolutions" episode aired on January 7, 1999, not October 1, 1998, as per the table provided.
1865	The statement is refuted by the table. The episode with 23.9 million US viewers was "The One with All the Thanksgivings", which had a production code of 467659.
1866	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Collingwood scored 16.22 (118) against Hawthorn at Princes Park in the 1982 VFL season. Hawthorn, on the other hand, scored 20.20 (140) in the same match.
1867	The statement is supported by the table. In the table, the second row shows that Footscray scored 7.8 (50) against Richmond, and the third row shows that Fitzroy scored 21.16 (142) against St Kilda.
1868	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as there is no occurrence of an away team score of "16.22 (118)" in the table. The highest away team score listed in the table is "16.16 (112)" in row 1, where the home team Footscray scored 50 points. Therefore, we cannot verify the statement using this table.
1869	The statement is supported by the table. The row 3 of the table shows that "Fitzroy" was the home team with a score of "21.16 (142)" and "St Kilda" was the away team with a score of "11.12 (78)".
1870	The statement is incorrect. There is no reference to a skip named Ron MacDonald in the provided table for the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. The only skip listed with a similar name is Rod Macdonald from Prince Edward Island, who had a pf (points for) of 67 and 5 lost ends, not 51.
1871	The statement is supported by the table. In row 5, it can be seen that the skip Jean-Michel Ménard has a shot percentage of 80% and there were 8 blank ends in their matches during the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier.
1872	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table because there are multiple rows where the win (w) is 6 and the value of blank ends ranges from 7 to 18. Therefore, the lowest value for blank ends when the win is 6 is not 10.
1873	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the provided table as there is no row in the table where the value in the "blank ends" column is 9. The highest value in the "blank ends" column is 18 for British Columbia in row 6.
1874	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted based on the given table. The table includes data for each team's wins and losses, points for (PF), points against (PA), ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot percentage but does not show any information on the correlation between points scored and ends lost.
1875	The statement cannot be verified using the provided table as there is no row with a value of 8 for "blank ends". The highest value for "blank ends" in the table is 18. Additionally, the statistics in the table do not provide any information related to the occurrence of shot pct values in relation to blank ends.
1876	The statement is supported by the table. In row 1 of the table, the locale is listed as Alberta and the value of l is listed as 9.
1877	The statement cannot be verified or refuted using the provided table since the value of blank ends when stolen ends is 7 is not present in the table. The row with 7 stolen ends belongs to Quebec and shows 8 blank ends. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm whether the statement is true or false using the given table.
1878	The statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by the given table as there is no value of 9 in the "Blank Ends" column. Therefore, there is no reference to the value of "Ends Lost" when "Blank Ends" equals 9.
1879	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the settlement of Lok has a population of 1114 in the year 2011.
1880	Supported. According to the table, "Lok" is listed as a "village" in the "type" column in row 4. Thus, the statement that "the settlement of Lok is a village" is supported by the table.
1881	The statement cannot be verified by the provided table, as it only shows the population and other information on four settlements - Titel, Gardinovci, Lok, Mošorin, and Šajkaš. It does not show any direct comparison between Titel and Lok, nor does it provide any information that suggests that the two settlements differ only in population.
1882	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, Lok had the smallest population in 2011, with a population of 1,114, while Gardinovci had a population of 1,297. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1883	Supported. According to the table, in the 1980 United States House of Representatives elections, the incumbent for the Illinois 20th district was Republican Paul Findley, who was first elected in 1960 and was re-elected in 1980. This supports the statement that "Republican Paul Findley was first elected in 1960."

1885	The statement is supported by the table. In Illinois 6, Henry Hyde, the Republican incumbent, was re-elected with 67.0% of the vote, beating Democrat Mario Reymond Reda who received 33.0% of the vote.
1886	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Paul Findley was first elected in 1960 from Illinois district 20, whereas Henry Hyde was first elected in 1974 from Illinois district 6. Therefore, Henry Hyde was actually elected after Paul Findley.
1887	The statement is not fully supported by the table. The table shows that Cardiss Collins was re-elected as a Democrat in 1980, but it does not provide information on her first election. However, according to public records, Cardiss Collins was first elected to the House of Representatives in a special election in 1973, not 1969.
1888	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Phil Crane was a Republican incumbent who was re-elected in Illinois District 12 in 1980, and Henry Hyde was a Republican incumbent who was also re-elected in Illinois District 6. There is no mention of Henry Hyde ever being a Democrat, nor does it show that he lost to Phil Crane in 1974.

The 2010-2011 season had Teikyo as the winner with a score of 17-14 against Waseda, and an attendance of 25,458.
1894	The statement is incorrect. The 47th All-Japan University Rugby Championship in the table is for the 2011-12 season, where Teikyo won the title and Tenri was the runner-up with the match held in Tokyo's National Stadium. The runner-up for the 2010-11 season is not mentioned in the table.
1895	The statement is refuted by the table. Tenri is not listed as a winner in any of the games listed in the table, and Teikyo was not listed as a runner-up in any game where Tenri was the winner. The table shows that Teikyo won the 48th, 47th, 46th, 45th, and 44th championships, but Tenri is not listed as the runner-up in any of these games. In the 48th championship, Tenri was not even listed as one of the teams that participated.

1898	The statement "week 4 had a higher attendance than week 3" cannot be fully supported or refuted by the table alone because it only provides the attendance figures for each game, not a comparison of the attendance between weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the attendance at week 4 was higher than that of week 3 solely based on the given table.
1899	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table. The table provides the attendance figures for each of the Oakland Raiders' home games in the 1997 season but does not give attendance figures for away games. Therefore, we cannot determine if the game against the New Orleans Saints had the least attendance of the season.
1900	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Antonio Pompa-Baldi from Italy was the first-place winner in the Cleveland International Piano Competition in 1999.
