6	Refuted. According to the table, "The Witchfinder" episode is listed as number 20 and aired on November 7, 2009, while "Sweet Dreams" is listed as number 23 and aired on November 28, 2009. Therefore, "The Witchfinder" episode happened earlier in the series than "Sweet Dreams".
7	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, David Moore directed three episodes of series 2 of Merlin, not five.
8	Refuted. The Lady of the Lake episode had the highest UK viewers with 6.3 million viewers, whereas the episode with the lowest UK viewers was The Beauty and the Beast (Part 1) with 5.53 million viewers.

10	Refuted - according to the table, "Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)" had 6.14 million UK viewers, while "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)" had 5.53 million UK viewers, which means that "Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)" had more UK viewers than "Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)".
11	I'm sorry, but the given table does not contain information about the number of goals scored by each player. It only shows the number of appearances each player made in the league, title playoffs, and super cup for the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season, as well as their total appearances across all competitions. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
12	Sorry, but I cannot support or refute the given statement as the table only shows the number of games played and titles won by each player in the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season. It does not provide information about the goals scored by each player or their rankings in the Belgian First Division A League.
13	I'm sorry, but the table you provided does not include information on which players played in the Belgian Cup, so I cannot determine if the statement is supported or refuted. Can you provide me with additional information or a corrected table?
14	Sorry, I cannot provide a conclusion or answer for the statement because the given table does not contain any information regarding the UEFA Champions League tournament.
15	I'm sorry, but the provided table only shows the number of goals scored by each player in the league, title playoff, and super cup. It doesn't provide any information on the total number of goals they scored throughout the season. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
16	Sorry, but the given table does not provide information regarding the number of goals scored by each player. It only shows the number of appearances made by each player in the League, Title Playoff, and Super Cup matches, as well as their total appearances. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
17	I'm sorry, but the given table about "2008 - 09 r.s.c. anderlecht season" does not provide information about the number of goals scored by each player. The table only shows the number of appearances made by each player in the league, title playoff, super cup, and the total number of appearances. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
18	I'm sorry, but I cannot support or refute that statement as the table provided does not contain information about who played in the Belgian Cup, let alone track their individual goal tallies. The table only shows the number of games played and goals scored in the league, title playoffs, and super cup.
19	The table does not provide information about goals or assists made by the players in any specific tournament, thus it does not support or refute the statement.
20	I'm sorry, but I cannot support the statement. The provided table is about the number of titles won by individual players of R.S.C. Anderlecht in the 2008-09 season, not the number of goals scored by each player. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the number of goals between Matias Suarez and Bart Goor.
21	Supported. Three of the people tied for ninth place, Paul Azinger, Hubert Green, and Tom Kite, are from the United States, as indicated in rows 10, 11, and 12 of the table.
22	Supported - Looking at the table, out of the six players who finished the tournament under par, four of them are from the United States, including the winner Curtis Strange. Only two were from outside the United States - Ian Woosnam from Wales and Masashi Ozaki from Japan.
23	Refuted. While Masashi Ozaki from Japan did have a score of 281, the other Japanese players did not compete (as seen from the absence of a "country" designation on the table), so it is not possible to calculate an average score for players from Japan.
24	Supported. According to the table, players from four countries participated in the 1989 U.S. Open golf tournament: United States, Wales, Japan, and Spain.
25	Supported. According to the table, Ian Woosnam from Wales finished tied for second in the 1989 U.S. Open and won $67,823, which is indeed the most amount of money won by someone from Wales in that tournament.
26	Refuted. According to the table, there is only one person who tied for fifth place, which is Brian Claar from the United States. Therefore, the statement that three people tied for fifth place from the United States is refuted.
27	Refuted. Among the 13 players listed, only three players scored over par, and two of them were from outside the United States (Masashi Ozaki from Japan scored +1 and Ian Woosnam from Wales scored -1). Thus, the majority (10) of the players either scored under par or at even par, and the statement that a majority of players who scored over par are from the United States is not supported by the table.
28	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that the only player from Japan, Masashi Ozaki, had a total score of 281, not an average score of 251.
29	Supported. According to the table, there are five countries represented by the players: United States, Wales, Japan, Spain, and the unspecified country of Chip Beck.
30	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Ian Woosnam from Wales won $67,823, while Curtis Strange from the United States won $200,000. Therefore, the most amount of money won at the 1989 U.S. Open by someone from Wales is $67,823, not $46,823.
31	Supported. All the players listed in the table except for Ladislav Scurko, who is from Slovakia, are from North America.

37	Supported. According to the table, there are 7 players from Canada and 4 players from the United States, which means that the number of players from Canada is greater than the number from the United States.
38	Supported. All players in the table are listed with their college or junior/club team (league) as their respective origins, indicating that they all came from either a college program or a junior/club team.
39	The statement is refuted. According to the table, there were varying numbers of players drafted in each round between rounds 3 and 9, with some rounds having two players drafted and others having only one. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.
40	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table because it only provides information about the position, nationality, and team of each player, but it does not specify the round in which each player was drafted. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Triston Grant plays the same position as the other player drafted in his round.
41	Supported. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy beer won prizes in the following years: 1995, 2002, 2005, 2009. Therefore, the statement that the beer had five awards between 1995 and 2009 is supported.

45	The statement is supported. According to the table, West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal in the Mild and Porter category at both the 2003 and 2006 SIBA National Beer Competitions, between the years 1995 and 2009.

The beer, on the other hand, received a gold medal at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition in 2002 and 2005 and a silver medal at the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2006.
50	Supported. According to the table, three games (Game 1, 2, and 7) had the same attendance of 18,422 at the US Airways Center.

57	Supported. According to the table, the game at the Target Center occurred on April 11th (row 7) and the game at the FedExForum occurred on April 10th (row 6), indicating that the game at the FedExForum did, in fact, take place after the game at the Target Center.
58	Refuted. According to the table, the game against Minnesota had an attendance of 18,478 while the game against New Orleans had an attendance of 17,781. Therefore, the statement is false as the game against New Orleans had a lower attendance than the game against Minnesota.
59	Supported. According to the table, the game against New Orleans on April 8 had an attendance of 17,781, which is the highest attendance of all the games listed.

64	Supported. According to the table, Linda Fratianne from the United States won the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships, while Natalia Strelkova from the Soviet Union placed 13th. Therefore, Strelkova did not win the championship.
65	Supported. According to the table, Emi Watanabe was ranked number 3 with 180.52 points, while Dagmar Lurz was ranked number 4 with 179.96 points. Therefore, Emi Watanabe was two places higher than Dagmar Lurz, supporting the statement.
66	The statement is not supported. The highest score was 186.92 and the lowest score was 112.28, which gives a difference of 74.64 points, not 64.64 points as stated.
67	The statement is supported by the table. Linda Fratianne finished in first place with a score of 186.92, while Anett Pötzsch finished in second place with a score of 184.36. Therefore, Anett Pötzsch did not manage to get in the top 3.
68	Supported, according to the table, Natalia Strelkova from the Soviet Union received 164.94 points and finished 13th out of 31 skaters, therefore, she did not come in last place with 112.28 points.
69	Supported. According to the table, Mark Cockerell of the United States scored 172.42 points and placed first, while Patrice Macrez of France scored 151.76 points and placed seventh, indicating that Cockerell finished with a better score than Macrez.
70	Supported. While West Germany had two skaters place in the top six, i.e., Norbert Schramm at fourth place and Stephan Bril at sixth place, none of them won a medal. The medals were won by skaters from the United States, Japan, and Canada.
71	Supported. According to the table, Pierre Lamine has 150.5 points and is ranked 8th, while Shinji Someya has 150.34 points and is ranked 9th. Therefore, Pierre Lamine has only 0.16 more points than Shinji Someya.
72	Supported - According to the table, Patrice Macrez from France finished in 7th place with a total of 151.76 points and Pierre Lamine from France finished in 8th place with a total of 150.5 points.
73	That statement is refuted by the table. The gap between first and last place was calculated by subtracting the points of the first place skater from the points of the last place skater: 172.42 - 114.38 = 58.04. Therefore, the statement is technically correct. However, the last place skater is not listed as 19th in the table, but rather as 18th. So, if the statement is referring to the gap between first and eighteenth place, then it is supported by the table.
74	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Mark Cockerell finished first with a score of 172.42, while Patrice Macrez finished seventh with a score of 151.76. Therefore, Mark Cockerell finished with a better score than Patrice Macrez.
75	The statement is refuted by the table. While West Germany had two representatives in the competition and placed fourth and sixth, the gold medal was won by Mark Cockerell of the United States.
76	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Pierre Lamine received 150.5 points and Shinji Someya received 150.34 points. Therefore, Pierre Lamine beat Shinji Someya by less than a point (0.16 points to be exact).
77	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, France had two competitors, Patrice Macrez and Pierre Lamine, who finished 7th and 8th, respectively. Therefore, not all of France's competitors finished better than 5th.
78	Supported. The gap between first place and last place in the table for the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships was 57.44 points (172.42 - 114.98), which is less than 50 points.
79	Sorry, I cannot support or refute the statement as the table only provides the scores for each game and not the total number of points scored by each team across all games.
80	The statement is supported. According to the table, on January 5th, 2004, Detroit had a home team score of 6, while playing against Nashville. Therefore, Detroit had the highest home team score, at 6 points, as stated in the statement.
81	Supported. According to the table, Detroit scored 6 points on January 5th against Nashville, which was the highest score of the season.
82	Supported, according to the table, attendance of 20066 did occur on 6 different dates during the 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season.
83	Supported. According to the table, on January 5th, the Detroit Red Wings played against the Nashville Predators and won with a score of 6-0, resulting in a difference of 6 points. This was the largest point gap between the Red Wings and their opponents during the listed games in the table.
84	Sorry, but I cannot support that statement with the given table. The table provides data on the Detroit Red Wings' home and away games, but it only shows their scores and does not indicate which scores were made at home or away games. Additionally, the table does not provide information on the scores of other teams. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether or not Detroit had one of the lowest visitor scores in the league for the 2003-04 season from this table.
85	Sorry, I cannot confirm whether the statement is supported or refuted based on the table provided because it only shows the scores for the Detroit Red Wings and their opponents, but not the scores of other home teams.
86	Refuted. There is no data in the table about scoring stats, only the scores of individual games. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the Detroit Red Wings were the lowest scoring team in the league based solely on this table.
87	Supported. According to the table, the attendance rate of 20066 occurred in four different games: January 3 (Anaheim vs Detroit), January 5 (Nashville vs Detroit), January 14 (Chicago vs Detroit), and January 31 (Carolina vs Detroit). So, the statement that the low attendance rate of 20066 occurred multiple times is supported.
88	The statement is refuted by the table. There was no tie for the largest point gap during the season. The table only provides information on the scores of individual games and the team's overall record, but does not provide information on the point gap or any ties related to it.
89	Supported. According to the table, the term start for Vilson Ahmeti was on December 10, 1991, while the term start for Bashkim Fino was on March 11, 1997. Therefore, the term start for Bashkim Fino was after the term start for Vilson Ahmeti.
90	Supported. According to the table, Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were all members of the Socialist Party of Albania political party during their respective terms as prime minister.
91	Refuted. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term ended on December 10, 1991, while Vilson Ahmeti's term ended on April 13, 1992. Therefore, the statement is refuted, not supported.
92	The table about "List of prime ministers of Albania" does not support the statement "Sali Berisha was the first person since Aleksandër Meksi, to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party". This statement is refuted by the table as Aleksandër Meksi was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania and was elected as Prime Minister of Albania from April 1992 to March 1997 while Sali Berisha was elected as Prime Minister in September 2005 which is many years after the term of Aleksandër Meksi. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
93	Supported. According to the table, only Fatos Nano (1st time) was a member of the Party of Labour of Albania, while the other prime ministers belonged to either the Socialist Party of Albania or the Democratic Party of Albania.
94	Supported. According to the table, Ylli Bufi's term start was on June 5, 1991, while Vilson Ahmeti's term start was on December 10, 1991, which is after Ylli Bufi's term start.
95	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) were members of the Socialist Party of Albania, while Ilir Meta was the only prime minister listed who was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.
96	Supported. According to the table, Aleksandër Meksi's term lasted from April 13, 1992, to March 11, 1997, while Ylli Bufi's term ended on December 10, 1991. Therefore, the term end for Aleksandër Meksi was after the term end for Ylli Bufi.
97	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Aleksandër Meksi was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party during his term as prime minister from April 13, 1992, to March 11, 1997, while Ilir Meta, who served as prime minister from October 29, 1999, to February 22, 2002, was also a member of the Socialist Party of Albania political party. Therefore, Ilir Meta was not the first person since Aleksandër Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party.
98	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, multiple people have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania, including Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano (2nd time), Pandeli Majko (1st time), Ilir Meta, Pandeli Majko (2nd time), and Edi Rama, who is the incumbent Prime Minister.
99	Supported. According to the table, there were two players with the last name Dawkins who played for the Utah Jazz: Darryl Dawkins who played from 1987-1988, and Paul Dawkins who played in 1979-1980. However, the years they played for the team did not overlap, supporting the statement that the Jazz had two players with the last name Dawkins, but their time on the team did not overlap.
100	The statement is refuted as Paul Dawkins only played for the Jazz in 1979-80 while Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1987-88.
101	Refuted. According to the table, Adrian Dantley played for the Utah Jazz from 1979-1986, while Brad Davis only played for the Jazz in 1979-1980. Therefore, they were not on the team for the same amount of time.
102	Supported. According to the table, James Donaldson is listed twice with two different years of playing for the Utah Jazz: 1993 and 1994-95. This confirms that he had two separate stints on the Jazz's roster.
103	Supported. According to the table, there were three guards on the Utah Jazz all-time roster for the year 1979-80: Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, and Greg Deane.
104	Refuted. Although the Utah Jazz had two players on their all-time roster with the last name Dawkins, their time on the team did not overlap. Paul Dawkins was a guard for the Jazz in 1979-80, while Darryl Dawkins was a center for the Jazz in 1987-88.
105	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1987-88, which means he only played one year. Meanwhile, Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz in 1979-80, which makes him play for the team before Darryl Dawkins.
106	The statement is refuted. Although both Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis were on the Utah Jazz roster in 1979 - 1980, Adrian Dantley only played for the Jazz from 1979 - 1986 while Brad Davis only played for one year. Therefore, Adrian Dantley did surpass Davis by more than four additional years, but they were not on the team for the same duration of time.
107	Refuted. According to the table, James Donaldson had two stints on the Jazz's roster, but the total number of years he spent with the team was three, not five. He played for the Jazz in 1993, as well as in 1994-95.
108	Sorry, I cannot determine if that statement is supported or refuted by the table as it only lists two guards for the 1979-80 season (Brad Davis and Paul Dawkins) and James Donaldson is listed as a center who played for the team in 1993 and 1994-95.
109	Sorry to inform you that the statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, The Open Championship is not the tournament with the highest number of events - it is the tournament with the highest number of cuts made (4). The total number of events for each tournament are: Masters Tournament (2), US Open (2), The Open Championship (7), and PGA Championship (6).
110	Supported. According to the table, in all four tournaments listed, Brian Watts did not win any of them. The "Wins" row shows all zeros, indicating no wins in any of the four tournaments.
111	That statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the PGA Championship had four cuts made while the US Open had only one cut made. Therefore, the PGA Championship had three more cuts made than the US Open.
112	The statement is refuted by the table. The table does not provide information on the average number of events for all the tournaments listed.
113	The table shows that Brian Watts did not win, have a top-5 finish, or make the top-25 at the Masters Tournament. He participated in two Masters Tournaments and made the cut in only one of them. Therefore, the statement "Brian Watts did not make the top-25 at the Masters Tournament" is supported by the table.
114	Supported. According to the table, Brian Watts has played in seven Open Championships, which is the highest number of events he has participated in among all the listed tournaments. Therefore, the statement that The Open Championship is the tournament with his second-highest number of events is supported.
115	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Brian Watts did not win any major tournaments.
116	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Brian Watts did not make any cuts in the PGA Championship and made one cut in the US Open. Therefore, he had three fewer cuts made in the PGA Championship than in the US Open.
117	The statement is supported. According to the table, in the Masters Tournament, Brian Watts had 0 wins, 0 top-5 finishes, 0 top-25 finishes, and only made 1 cut out of 2 events participated. Thus, he did not have a top-25 finish in the tournament.
118	According to the table, there are four viral families that have a replication site in the nucleus: Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Hepadnaviridae, and Retroviridae. Therefore, the statement "9 viral families had a replication site in the nucleus" is refuted.
119	Supported. According to the table, 14 viral families had a replication site in the cytoplasm (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae).
120	Support: According to the table, two viral families, Herpesviridae and Poxviridae, have a "complex" virion shape. All other viral families listed have a "icosahedral" or "helical" virion shape.
121	Supported. According to the table, thirteen viral families have an icosahedral virion shape (adenoviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae, astroviridae, caliciviridae, picornaviridae, flaviviridae, togaviridae, hepeviridae, unassigned, and reoviridae).
122	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, there are seven viral families that have a helical virion shape: Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae.
123	According to the table, nine of the viral diseases replicate in the nucleus, which supports the statement. The viral families that replicate in the nucleus are adenoviridae, herpesviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, retroviridae, orthomyxoviridae, and the unassigned group.
124	The table about "viral disease" does support the statement that "only one of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape". According to the table, there is only one entry in the "virion shape" column with the value "spherical", which is present in row 23 under the "unassigned" family.
125	Supported. According to the table, eight families of viral diseases are classified as "non-enveloped": Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae.
126	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, reoviridae is the only viral disease that belongs to Baltimore group III.
127	Supported. According to the table, row 23 states that there is an unassigned viral disease, which is the only one that has not been assigned to a family.
128	Supported. Based on the information presented in the table, 9 viral families have a replication site in the cytoplasm: Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae.
129	According to the table, only three viral families have a replication site in the nucleus (Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, and Hepadnaviridae), so the statement is refuted.
130	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the viral families "Orthomyxoviridae" and "Arenaviridae" both have a helical virion shape, which makes it a total of two viral families with this feature.
131	The statement "thirteen viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported by the table. According to the table, there are six viral families (Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Retroviridae, and Paramyxoviridae) with an enveloped, helical virion shape, and five viral families (Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae) with an enveloped, helical or bullet-shaped virion shape. This makes a total of eleven viral families with an enveloped, helical virion shape. Additionally, there is one unassigned viral family with a spherical virion shape. Therefore, the statement that "thirteen viral families have a helical virion shape" is supported.
132	Supported. According to the table, seven viral families (adenoviridae, papillomaviridae, polyomaviridae, hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae, caliciviridae, picornaviridae) have an icosahedral virion shape.
133	Supported. Nine viral diseases in the table replicate outside the nucleus, which are Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae.
134	I'm sorry, but the statement "none of the viral diseases has a spherical virion shape" is refuted by the table. According to row 23, there is an unassigned family that has an enveloped spherical virion shape.
135	Supported. According to the table, eight viral diseases possess an enveloped, which are herpesviridae, poxviridae, hepadnaviridae, coronaviridae, flaviviridae, togaviridae, hepeviridae, and retroviridae.
136	Sorry, I cannot support or refute a statement that has not been provided to me. Please provide me with the statement you would like me to analyze.
137	I'm sorry, but there is not enough information in the table to support or refute the statement. The table contains information about various viral families and their characteristics, but it does not provide any specific information about viral diseases themselves, their names, or whether they have been assigned to a family or not.
138	Sorry, I need to correct myself. The statement should be "galina voskoboeva played a total of 1 game on a hard tennis court".
139	Refuted. According to the table, Galina Voskoboeva played only one out of five tournaments on a clay surface court, which is equivalent to 20%.
140	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Galina Voskoboeva has won all of her matches on hard courts and only one on clay court. Therefore, her win rate on hard courts is much higher than her win rate on clay courts.
141	Supported. According to the table, none of the opponents listed for Galina Voskoboeva appear more than once. Therefore, she never played the same opponent more than one time.
142	Sorry, I cannot support or refute the statement "on average, Galina Voskoboeva loses with only four points" based on the given table. The table only provides information on the opponent, tournament, date, outcome, score, and surface of the matches, but it does not contain enough data to calculate an average score difference in Voskoboeva's losses.
143	Sorry, but that statement is incorrect. The table shows that Galina Voskoboeva played two matches on hard court and two matches on clay court. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
144	The statement "Galina Voskoboeva played 20% of her games on a clay top tennis court and 1% on hard" is refuted by the table. The table shows that out of the 5 tournaments listed for Galina Voskoboeva, she played on clay in only one tournament (Latina) and on hard in three tournaments (Tipton, Pittsburgh, and Mont-de-Marsan). Therefore, the statement does not align with the data presented in the table.
145	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Galina Voskoboeva has won one tournament on hard court and one tournament on clay court. However, she has also been a runner-up in three tournaments, two of which were on clay court and one of which was on hard court. Therefore, she has a higher win rate on hard court and has not won on clay court.
146	Supported. According to the table, Galina Voskoboeva did not play the same opponent more than once, except on 6 June 2006, where she played against Alice Canepa and won the match.
147	Sorry, I cannot generate an answer to this statement. The given table only provides the scores and outcomes of a few matches played by Galina Voskoboeva, and there is no numerical data to calculate an average score difference for any opponent. Therefore, I cannot say whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
148	Supported. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 13 out of the 24 total races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
149	Supported. According to the table, Alfredo Binda won 6 races over the course of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, but he was the race leader for 13 of the races.
150	The statement is supported because according to the table, on May 26, 1933, Gerard Loncke from Belgium won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano, despite Alfredo Binda being the race leader at that point.
151	Supported. According to the table, Ettore Meini won two races in a row on May 24th and 25th during the 1933 Giro d'Italia, which were the 20th and 21st stages, respectively.
152	Supported. According to the table, Learco Guerra was the race leader for the first race of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, but after that, Alfredo Binda became the race leader and held the position for the rest of the circuit.
153	Supported, according to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
154	The statement is refuted. Although Alfredo Binda won seven races, including the overall race, as per the table, he was the race leader for 14 races, not 15.
155	Sorry, but that statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader on May 25th, and Gerard Loncke won the stage on May 26th. Alfredo Binda also remained the race leader who won the entire 1933 Giro d'Italia race.
156	I'm sorry, but the statement "Ettore Meini won three races in a row, on May 24th, 25th, and 26th, during the 1933 Giro d'Italia" is refuted by the table. Although Ettore Meini did win the stage from Ferrara to Udine on May 24th, he did not win the following two stages. Rather, he finished second and sixth, respectively, in those stages. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
157	The statement is refuted by the table. Alfredo Binda was the race leader after the second stage of the race and held on to the lead until the end of the race, winning the overall title. While Learco Guerra won the first stage and briefly held the lead, he did not become the race leader again for the rest of the circuit.
158	Supported. According to the table, two players were picked during the 2nd round of the draft, with Ray Donaldson and Tim Foley both being selected.
159	Supported. According to the table, Wes Roberts was selected with the 170th overall pick in the 7th round, while Ed Whitley was chosen with the 280th overall pick in the 11th round, indicating that Roberts was selected before Whitley.
160	Supported. The table shows that two players were drafted from USC (Ray Butler and Chris Foote) while only one player (Marvin Sims) was drafted from Clemson. Therefore, more players were drafted from USC than from Clemson.
161	Supported. According to the table, the last running back selected was Mark Bright in the 9th round, and there were no running backs selected in rounds 10-12. Therefore, the statement is supported.
162	Supported. According to the table, Curtis Dickey was picked in the first round, pick 5, while Randy Bielski was picked in the 12th round, pick 6. Therefore, Curtis Dickey was selected in an earlier round than Randy Bielski.
163	Supported, the table shows that 2 players were picked in the 2nd round of the draft, which are Ray Donaldson and Tim Foley.
164	The statement is refuted by the table. The table only goes up to the 12th round, and it shows that Wes Roberts was picked in the 7th round and Ed Whitley was picked in the 11th round. Neither of them were picked in the 3rd round.
165	Refuted. According to the table, USC and Clemson College each had only one player drafted, not three.
166	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, only two running backs were picked, namely Curtis Dickey in the first round and Mark Bright in the ninth round. Therefore, the statement that there were 3 running back positions picked by the 6th round is not supported by this table.
167	The statement, "Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski were picked in round 2" is refuted by the table. Curtis Dickey was picked in round 1 with the 5th overall pick, while Randy Bielski was picked in round 12 with the 6th and 311th overall pick.
168	Refuted. According to the table, Italy received 2 gold medals, while Canada did not win any gold medals. Additionally, Italy did not tie with either the United States or West Germany in terms of gold medals. Italy won 2 gold medals, while the United States won 2 gold medals and West Germany won 2 gold medals.
169	Refuted. According to the table, Sweden won a total of 6 medals while Austria won a total of 10 medals, therefore Austria placed higher than Sweden in the total medal count.
170	Supported. According to the table, six different countries received a total of 5 bronze medals each during the 1988 Winter Olympics: Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, West Germany, the United States, and Italy.
171	Supported. According to the table, Sweden received 4 gold medals, 0 silver medals, and 2 bronze medals, and Canada did not win any gold medals, won 2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals, meaning both countries did not receive a medal in at least one of the three categories of gold, silver, or bronze.
172	Supported. According to the table, the Soviet Union received a total of 29 medals (11 gold, 9 silver, and 9 bronze) and East Germany received a total of 25 medals (9 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, the Soviet Union received four more medals than East Germany in the total medal count.
173	Sorry, but the statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Italy received two gold medals, which is fewer than the 0 gold medals received by Canada, and they did not tie with the United States or West Germany in terms of gold medals.
174	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Sweden won a total of 6 medals (4 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze) while Austria won a total of 10 medals (3 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze) in the 1988 Winter Olympics. Therefore, Sweden placed higher than Austria in the total medal count.
175	Refuted - According to the table, only two countries received the same number of bronze medals, which are Netherlands and West Germany, both receiving 2 bronze medals.
176	Unsupported. While Canada did not receive a gold medal and had two bronze medals, Sweden received gold medals and did not place in only one of the three categories.
177	The statement is supported by the table. The Soviet Union received a total of 29 medals (11 gold, 9 silver, and 9 bronze) while East Germany received a total of 25 medals (9 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, the Soviet Union received six more medals than East Germany.
178	Supported. According to the table, NGC 1796 has an apparent magnitude of 12.9, which is the largest among all the objects listed. NGC 1705 has an apparent magnitude of 12.8, making it second to NGC 1796 in terms of apparent magnitude.
179	Supported. According to the table, the redshift of NGC 1705 is listed as 633 ± 6 km/s, which is the smallest redshift value listed in the table.
180	Supported. According to the table, the redshift of NGC 2082 is 1184 ± 6 km/s, while the redshift of NGC 1705 is 633 ± 6 km/s. Therefore, the redshift of NGC 2082 is faster than that of NGC 1705 by 1184 - 633 = 551 km/s plus or minus 6 km/s.
181	Supported. According to the table, NGC 1574 has a declination of degree 58′29″, which is the largest among all the galaxies in the Dorado Group.
182	That statement is supported by the table, as the right ascension of NGC 1533, listed in row 11, is indeed the lowest in the table at 4 hours 9 minutes and 51.8 seconds.
183	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, NGC 1796 has the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9, while NGC 1688 and NGC 2082 both have an apparent magnitude of 12.6. NGC 1515 has an apparent magnitude of 12.1, and NGC 1705 has an apparent magnitude of 12.8. Therefore, NGC 1515 does not have the largest apparent magnitude.
184	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. The row for NGC 1796 shows a redshift of 1014 kilometers per second plus or minus 9 kilometers per second, which is not the largest redshift in the table. The largest redshift is indicated in row 15, for NGC 1566, with a value of 1504 kilometers per second plus or minus 2 kilometers per second.
185	Supported. According to the table, NGC 1705 has a redshift of 633 km/s, while NGC 2082 has a redshift of 1,184 km/s. Therefore, the difference in their redshifts is 551 km/s. The statement mentions a difference of 441 km/s, which falls within the calculated difference of the table within the measurement uncertainties.
186	I'm sorry, I cannot support or refute the statement since the table does not provide the declination (or dec) of NGC 2082 as °59′28″ or any information about the declination of the other galaxies in the Dorado Group. The table only provides the coordinates and redshift of each galaxy, as well as its apparent magnitude and type.
187	I'm sorry, but the statement mentioned is not supported or refuted by the given table about the Dorado Group. The table doesn't contain any row with a right ascension of 4 hours 8 minutes and 58.1 seconds, and therefore, the table cannot inform about the lowest right ascension value.
188	Supported. According to the table, the earliest date and site is September 4, 2007, and the site was Cedar Rapids.
189	Supported. According to the table, volleyball took place on September 8, 2007, and several other sports occurred on earlier dates which include m golf on September 4, 2007. Therefore, volleyball is the sport with the 2nd earliest date.
190	Supported – according to the table, the last sport listed in the "Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series" is softball, which took place on April 1, 2008.
191	Supported. According to the table, the earliest date in 2008 is February 22 and the sport on that date was "w gymnastics", which supports the statement that "w gymnastics is the sport with the earliest date in 2008".
192	Supported. According to the table, wrestling is the sport with the latest date in 2007, and it took place on December 9, 2007.
193	Supported. According to the table, the earliest date mentioned is September 4, 2007, which took place in Cedar Rapids. The next game listed in the table isn't until September 8, 2007, which takes place in Des Moines. Therefore, Ames is not the site with the earliest date.
194	Supported. According to the table, the earliest date for a match in the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk series was September 8, 2007, and the sport played on that date was volleyball, which was won by Iowa State, making the statement true.
195	Supported. According to the table, the softball game was played on April 1, 2008. This is the latest date among all the sports listed in the table, except for the later gymnastics match played on March 7, 2008. Therefore, softball is the sport with the second latest date.
196	Supported - according to the table, the earliest date in 2007 was September 4th, when the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk series started with a men's golf match between Iowa State and Iowa. The first women's gymnastics match didn't take place until February 22nd, 2008, which is after all the other events listed in the table.
197	The statement is supported by the table. The wrestling match between Iowa and Iowa State took place on December 9, 2007, which is the latest date among all the matches listed in the table. There are no matches listed in the table that occurred in 2008, therefore, wrestling is indeed the sport with the latest date in 2008.
198	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography was won by Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long.
199	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, William Ivey Long was nominated for Best Costume Design in 2005 at the Tony Awards for "La Cage aux Folles (Musical)".
200	The statement is supported, as the table shows that Jerry Mitchell won a Tony Award for Best Choreography in 2005 for "La Cage aux Folles." It does not explicitly state that he is one of two winners, but there were multiple categories and nominees for each category.
201	The statement is supported by the table. Jerry Mitchell is listed as a nominee in the category of "Outstanding Choreography" and is one of three nominees.
202	Supported. According to the table, Gary Beach was nominated for the 2005 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical for his role in "La Cage aux Folles". Therefore, the statement "Gary Beach is one of four nominees for a Tony Award" is supported.
203	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, William Ivey Long was nominated for the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design, but he did not win for Outstanding Choreography.
204	The statement is refuted because according to the table, the nominee for best costume design in 2005 was William Ivey Long, but the award was not won and Long was only nominated.
205	The statement "Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards" is refuted by the table. Although Jerry Mitchell was nominated for two Tony Awards (Best Choreography and Best Direction of a Musical), he only won one (Best Choreography).
206	The statement "jerry mitchell was nominated for a drama desk award three times" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award twice, once in 2005 for Outstanding Choreography and once in 2013 for Outstanding Director of a Musical for "Kinky Boots." He did not receive a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Costume Design.
207	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical in 2005, but he did not win. Therefore, he is not listed as one of the four winners of a Tony Award in the table.
208	I'm sorry, but the table provided does not include the results of the Master Series Finals, only other tournaments. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
209	The statement is not supported by the table. Looking at the scores in the table, only 4 out of the 7 listed finals have a score of 6 points or more for one side, and even then, only one of them is for Hewitt himself (his victory against Henman in Indian Wells 2002). There is no indication that the same pattern holds for the other 12 unlisted finals, but even if it did, it would only bring the total to 5 out of 19, not even close to a majority. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
210	Supported. According to the table, the 2002 Paris championship was played on a carpet surface, while all the other championships were played on hard surfaces.
211	Supported, according to the table Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up five times out of the seven total championships listed.
212	Supported. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt never faced the same opponent in more than one master series finals. Each of his six appearances in the final were against a different opponent.
213	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt has won the Masters Series once, in 2003 at Indian Wells, and was a runner-up in Cincinnati in 2002 and 2004 and in Indian Wells in 2005.
214	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Lleyton Hewitt played in a total of 7 Masters Series finals, not 19. Additionally, only 2 of those finals had a player finishing with 4 points (losing the match), while the other 5 had different scorelines.
215	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Lleyton Hewitt competed in the final of the Cincinnati championship twice, the surface of the tournament was not carpet for either year (2002 and 2004). According to the table, the 2002 Cincinnati championship final took place on a hard surface, and the 2004 Cincinnati championship final also took place on a hard surface. Therefore, the statement that "only the master series final in cincinnati had a carpet surface" is not supported by the table.
216	Supported. Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up one time out of a total of 7, according to the table.
217	The statement is refuted, as the table shows that Lleyton Hewitt only faced Wayne Ferreira in the 2000 Stuttgart Championship final, and not in every Masters Series final as the statement suggests.
218	Supported. The table clearly shows that there were games for the Kirin Cup on both May 17th and May 21st, 1998, as seen in rows 7 and 8.

221	The statement "neither team scored for the first two games of the World Cup in France" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the first two games of the World Cup in France in 1998 were played on June 10th, not listed in the table, between Brazil and Scotland (2-1) and Morocco and Norway (2-2), respectively. Therefore, both teams scored during these two games.
222	I'm sorry, but the statement is incorrect. According to the table, the game on June 18, 1998, had a score of 0-0, while the game on June 28, 1998, had a score of 0-0 at the end of the regulation time, with a final result of 0-0 (1-0 aet). Therefore, neither of those games had a score of 1-1.
223	Supported. According to the table, the Kirin Cup had games on both June 1 and 3, 1998. The games are listed in rows 8 and 9, with the match on June 1 taking place in the Philips Stadion Eindhoven, Netherlands, and ending with a score of 5-1, and the match on June 3 taking place in Steaua Stadium Bucharest, Romania, and ending with a score of 3-2.
224	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the World Cup games took place in France in June 1998, with four games listed on June 12, June 19, June 24, and June 28. There were no games listed in Japan in July 1998.

227	The statement is refuted because according to the table, there were no games on June 18 or June 28 in 1998 in Paraguayan football.
228	Supported. According to the table, the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US on 7 occasions from 1990 through 2013, including the years 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009, and 2013.
229	Sorry, but the statement "the United States team won 8 of the Solheim Cups starting in 1990 and the last was in 2009" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the United States team won a total of 6 Solheim Cups, not 8, starting in 1990 and their last victory was in 2009. The United States team won in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2009.
230	Refuted. According to the table, while Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin were captains for two winning teams, Kathy Whitworth was only a winning captain once in 1990. Therefore, the statement that all three were captains that won the cup two times is not supported.

234	Refuted. According to the table, the US won the Solheim Cup in 2015, which is not included in the table. So the statement is not accurate as it only considers the data in the table. Additionally, the table shows that the US has won the Solheim Cup on 9 occasions since 1990, not 7.
235	The statement is false. Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin both captained teams that won the Solheim Cup twice, and Kathy Whitworth captained the USA team that won in 1990 but did not win the cup as a captain for Europe.
236	Supported. According to the table, the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States six times from 1990 to 2013, in the years 1990, 1994, 1998, 2005, 2009, and 2013.

In the game against Oquist and the Athletics on August 31, the Rockies also won with a score of 10-4, but the pitcher who received the win was not specified in the table.
244	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, the attendance was less than 20,000 only on August 4th and August 5th. The attendance on August 6th was 26,633, which is higher than 20,000.
245	The statement is refuted by the table. There is no mention of attendance being 24343 on August 26 or 2142 on August 27. The attendance for August 26 was 48063 and for August 27 was 48032.
246	Sorry, I cannot support or refute the statement because there is no record of the score being 4-5 in the table. The closest scores to 4-5 are 5-4 and 3-4.
247	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, on August 27, 1997, the Reds' pitcher Remlinger (6-6) took the win against the Rockies with a score of 7-5.
248	The statement is supported. According to the table, two games took place in the month of December: one on December 5, 1976 against the Miami Dolphins, and another on December 12, 1976 against the Baltimore Colts.
249	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game on September 13, 1976, against the Miami Dolphins was 77,683 which is the largest attendance among all the games in the season.
250	The statement is supported by the table. The smallest attendance was at the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with a total of 44,505 attendees, while the games against the New England Patriots had attendances of 45,144 and 61,157.
251	Supported. According to the table, the attendance in week 12 was 66875, while the attendance in week 13 was 43475. Therefore, the statement that the attendance in week 12 was higher than the attendance in week 13 is supported by the table.
252	Supported. According to the table, the Buffalo Bills won only 2 out of their 14 games in the 1976 season, losing the other 12. Therefore, they lost more games than they won.
253	Supported. According to the table, there are two games that took place in the month of November and December - the game against the Dallas Cowboys on November 15 and the game against the Detroit Lions on November 25. Both of them were losses for the Buffalo Bills.
254	Sorry, the statement is actually "The Buffalo Bills won more games than they lost during the 1976 season." Please let me know if this statement is supported or refuted by the table.
255	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against the New England Patriots was 45,144, while the attendance for the game against the Baltimore Colts was 50,451. Therefore, the smallest attendance was indeed at the game against Baltimore Colts.
256	Supported. According to the table, the attendance in Week 6 was 71,009, the attendance in Week 12 was 66,875, and the attendance in Week 13 was 43,475. Therefore, the attendance in Week 12 was higher than both Week 6 and Week 13.
257	Supported. According to the table, the Buffalo Bills won only 2 out of their 14 games in the 1976 season, while losing the rest, which is a difference of 3 more losses than wins.
258	The statement is supported. According to the table, the Yugoslavia national football team played two friendly matches, and in both matches, they won by a score of 2:1 - the match against Uruguay in Sarajevo on March 22 and the match against Poland in Borovo on April 26.
259	Supported. According to the table, Yugoslavia lost 1-4 against Romania in the Balkan Cup on August 27, which was the worst outcome for them in the listed games.
260	The statement is refuted by the table. While the Yugoslavia national football team did lose a match against Romania in the Balkan Cup, the aggregate score is not mentioned in the table, and the results show that Yugoslavia won that match 2-0. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
261	Supported. According to the table, the Yugoslavia National Football Team failed to score only once, which was during the 1982 World Cup Qualifying match against Italy where they lost by a score of 0:2.
262	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Yugoslavia played three 1982 World Cup qualifying matches, where they scored a total of 7 goals and allowed 3 against. They won two matches and lost one.
263	Sorry, that statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Yugoslavia national team played two friendly matches against Uruguay and Poland, and won both matches by a score of 2:1, not 0:2.
264	The statement is incorrect. According to the table, Yugoslavia won the friendly against Uruguay 2-1, won the Balkan Cup match against Romania 2-0, and also won the friendly against Poland 2-1. The worst outcome mentioned in the table was a 1-4 defeat in the Balkan Cup against Romania on August 27. Therefore, the statement "the Yugoslavian national team suffered its worst outcome losing 2:1 in the Balkan Cup against Poland on March 26" is refuted by the table.
265	The statement is not supported by the table. The table only provides results for one game against Italy, which Yugoslavia lost 0-2, and one game against Romania, which Yugoslavia won 2-0. There is no information on a match between Italy and Romania, nor any mention of an aggregate score.
266	The statement is refuted by the table. The Yugoslavian national team failed to score twice, once on August 27 against Romania in the Balkan Cup, losing 1:4, and the second time on November 15 against Italy in the 1982 World Cup Qualifying, losing 0:2.
267	Supported. According to the table, the Yugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and allowed 3 against in the two 1982 World Cup qualifying scores (row 6 and row 7).
268	The statement is not supported by the table. While March does appear multiple times in the table, it is tied with October and December for the second-most frequent appearance with 4 games each. November is the month that features the most frequently in the table, with 5 games taking place in that month.
269	The statement is partially supported. According to the table, three of the games listed resulted in a 0-0 draw (games 22, 24, and 31). It's not clear whether there were any additional 0-0 draws, so the statement cannot be fully refuted or fully supported.
270	The statement is refuted by the table. While Bradford City played Aldershot Town during the season, they did not score their highest point total against them. In fact, they lost that game 2-3, which is a lower point total than some of their wins against other opponents. The highest point total they scored in a game during the season was 5, which they achieved in a home game against Aldershot Town.
271	The statement is refuted. According to the table, only two of the total games featured had an attendance in the 3000s (games 12 and 33).
272	Supported. The table shows that Bradford City played Port Vale twice during the 2008-09 season, with a result of 2-0 in their favor when they played away from home and a result of 0-1 against them when playing at home.
273	Sorry, I cannot provide an answer to that statement based on the given table as it only lists the dates of the games in chronological order and does not provide a breakdown by month.
274	Supported. According to the table, there were 5 games with a result of 0-0 and 2 games with a result of 5-0.
275	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, on 10 March 2009, Bradfort City played against Rochdale and lost with a score of 0-3, not against Aldershot Town. Therefore, Aldershot Town was not the opponent on 10 March 2009 when Bradford City scored their highest point total.
276	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that one game had an attendance in the 12000s (game 3), but none of the games had an attendance in the 3000s.
277	Supported. According to the table, Bradford City played against Port Vale on two occasions, on September 13th, 2008 and on March 28th, 2009.
278	Supported. According to the table, Michael Phelps has 28 Olympic medals while Larisa Latynina has 18 Olympic medals. Therefore, the statement that "Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latyna" is supported.
279	Supported. According to the table, Larisa Latynina has a total of 18 Olympic medals, while Carl Osburn has a total of 8 Olympic medals. Therefore, Larisa Latynina has 7 more medals than Carl Osburn.
280	Supported. According to the table, Robert Garrett and James Connolly both represent the United States.
281	Supported. According to the table, Hermann Weingärtner of Germany received a medal for pommel horse in gymnastics during the 1896 Olympics.
282	Supported. According to the table, Hermann Weingärtner, Carl Schuhmann, and Larisa Latynina all received medals in gymnastics, totaling to three athletes.
283	The statement is refuted by the table, because Michael Phelps has won 28 Olympic medals (the most of any athlete), while Larisa Latynina won 18 Olympic medals.
284	Refuted. According to the table, Larisa Latynina has won 18 Olympic medals, while Carl Osburn has won 8 Olympic medals. Therefore, Larisa Latynina has won 10 more Olympic medals than Carl Osburn, not 7 less.
285	The statement is supported by the table. Robert Garrett represented the United States, while James Connolly also represented the United States.
286	The statement is refuted by the table. The athlete Hermann Weingärtner received a medal (silver) for the pommel horse in the 1896 Olympics, as shown in row 13 of the table.
287	The statement is refuted by the table. The athlete Hermann Weingärtner from Germany received 3 medals in gymnastics during the 1896 Olympic games.
288	The statement is supported by the table. There are three translators in the 100s frequencies (100.7, 103.1, and 106.5) and three translators in the 90s frequencies (92.1, 95.9, and 92.5).
289	Supported. According to the table, all of the listed stations are classified as "D" for their FCC license class, therefore the statement is supported.
290	Supported. All of the call signs for each translator in the table start with the letter "W" followed by a three-digit number that begins with the number 2. For example, "W221BY," "W264BF," "W240BJ," etc.
291	Supported. According to the table, w293al has an ERP of 80 watts, which is the highest among all the call signs listed. On the other hand, w264bf has an ERP of only 2 watts, which is the lowest among all the call signs listed.
292	Supported. According to the table, there are three translators located in Illinois: W221BY in Elgin, W264BF in Englewood, and W276BM in Park Forest. Additionally, there are three located in Indiana: W240BJ in Crown Point, W293AL in Rochester, and W223AU in South Bend. This confirms that Illinois and Indiana each have three translators.
293	The statement is refuted by the table. The frequency ranges listed in the table for the different call signs do not show a consistent 5 MHz change range between them. For example, w221by has a frequency of 92.1 MHz, while w264bf has a frequency of 100.7 MHz, indicating a difference of 8.6 MHz. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that there is a 5 MHz frequency change range.
294	The statement is supported by the table. All the stations listed in the table have a class D license, except for one, which has a class C license.
295	Supported. According to the table, the ERPs for the listed stations range from 2 to 80 watts. Only one station, W264BF, has an ERP of 2 watts. Therefore, the statement "the number 2 is the only erp w" is true based on the information provided in the table.
296	Supported. According to the table, both w293al and w264bf have an ERP of 2 watts, which means they share the same ERP.
297	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that there are two translators in Illinois: W221BY in Elgin and W264BF in Englewood.
298	The statement is refuted because the results for the Australian Open and the French Open were different in 1996 and 1990. In 1996, Katrina Adams did not compete in the Australian Open (marked as "a" in the table), while she made it to the 2nd round in the French Open. In 1990, she lost in the 1st round of the Australian Open, but made it to the 3rd round in the French Open.
299	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Katrina Adams had different results in the US Open in 1986 and 1999. She was eliminated in the first round in 1986 and in the second round in 1999.
300	Supported. According to the table, Katrina Adams had only one "a" result (absent) at Wimbledon from 1986 to 1999. All other years show a specific result of at least the first round.
301	The statement is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that different tournaments had different results in the years 1990 and 1999. For example, in the Australian Open, Katrina Adams reached the third round in 1990 but lost in the first round in 1999. Similarly, in the US Open, she reached the third round in 1990 but lost in the first round in 1999. Therefore, we can say that each tournament did not have the same result in the years 1990 and 1999.
302	Supported. According to the table, the Australian Open had "a" (absent) listed as the result in three of the years (1986, 1991, and 1996), while Wimbledon only had "a" listed as the result in one year (1986).
303	Supported. According to the table, Katrina Adams did not compete in the Australian Open in 1996 (represented by "a" in the table), but she reached the quarterfinals in the French Open. Therefore, the results for the Australian Open and French Open in 1996 are different.
304	Supported. According to the table, Katrina Adams had a 1st round exit in the 1986 US Open, but improved to reach the 3rd round in the 1999 US Open.
305	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Katrina Adams reached the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1988 and the first round in 1999. Therefore, her result at Wimbledon was different in 1986 and 1999.
306	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Katrina Adams had a different result at the US Open in 1990 and 1999 compared to her results in the other years. In 1990, she lost in the first round, while in 1999, she lost in the second round. In all the other years listed in the table, her result at the US Open was either the third round or higher.
307	The statement is "the Australian Open had the same results as Wimbledon had", and this is refuted by the table. Looking at the table, we can see that Katrina Adams did not play in the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996, while she reached the quarterfinals in 1992 and the third round in 1988, 1989, and 1993. On the other hand, Adams played at Wimbledon every year from 1986 to 1998, and we can see that her results were not the same as her results at the Australian Open. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
308	The statement is partially supported. The table provided only shows the scores, teams, venues, crowds, and dates for the matches that took place on 23 June 1962. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from this table alone that the entire Victorian Football League (VFL) season took place only on that day. It is possible that there were matches played on other dates throughout the season that are not included in this table.
309	Supported - According to the table, the game between Footscray and Carlton was played at Princes Park.
310	Refuted. According to the table, the match between South Melbourne and Richmond at Lake Oval had a crowd of 17,000, while the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne at Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 8,470. Therefore, the statement is false as the game between South Melbourne and Richmond did not draw a bigger crowd than the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne.
311	I'm sorry, but the given table does not provide information regarding the number of teams that participated in the 1962 VFL season. Therefore, I cannot support or refute the statement.
312	Supported. According to the table, Collingwood scored 10.14 (74) points while Fitzroy scored 9.11 (65) points in their 1962 VFL match. Therefore, Collingwood scored more points than Fitzroy in that match.
313	The statement "in 1962, the VFL began in July" is refuted by the table. According to the table in row 2, the first game of the 1962 VFL season was played on June 23, 1962. Therefore, the VFL did not begin in July but rather on June 23, 1962.
314	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the game between Footscray and Fitzroy was not played at Windy Hill. Instead, it was played at Victoria Park.
315	Refuted. The match between North Melbourne and Hawthorn drew the smallest crowd of the day with only 8,470 attendees, as stated in row 7 of the table. The match between South Melbourne and Richmond had a larger crowd of 17,000 attendees, as stated in row 6 of the table. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
316	Supported. According to the table, Collingwood scored 10.14 (74) points and Hawthorn scored 10.7 (67) points, so Collingwood scored more points than Hawthorn in the 1962 VFL match.
317	Supported. According to the table, Harry Schell was listed as the driver for Ecurie Bleue and Philippe Etancelin was listed as a private driver.
318	Supported. According to the table, Rudi Fischer was the driver and Ecurie Espadon was the entrant when SVA-Fiat was the constructor and SVA 1500 was the chassis. Meanwhile, Reg Parnell was the driver and Scuderia Ambrosiana was the entrant when Maserati was the constructor and Maserati 4CLT-48 was the chassis.
319	Supported. According to the table, when the engine was "maserati l4s" and the driver was "prince bira", the entrant was "enrico platé". This information can be found in row 16 of the table.
320	Supported. The table shows that Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin were private entrants for the races they competed in, and their respective tyres were "p" and "d".
321	According to the table, the statement is supported. Peter Whitehead (row 13) drove a Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 125 with a Ferrari V12 engine and Pirelli tires (designated as "p" in the table). Similarly, Luigi Villoresi (row 12) also drove a Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 125 with a Ferrari V12 engine and Pirelli tires.
322	Refuted. According to the table, when the driver was Harry Schell, the entrant was Ecurie Bleue and not Scuderia Ambrosiana. Similarly, when the driver was Philippe Étancelin, the entrant was Private and not SA Alfa Romeo.
323	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Ecurie Espadon entered a car with an SVA-Fiat chassis, not a Talbot-Lago T26C chassis.
324	The statement is supported, as we can see from the table that Nino Farina drove an Alfa Romeo with an Alfa Romeo L8s engine, and not a Maserati with a Maserati L4s engine during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
325	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that Harry Schell and Johnny Claes were both private entrants during the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix. Harry Schell drove for Ecurie Bleue, a private team, and Johnny Claes drove for Ecurie Belge, which was also listed as a private entrant in the race.
326	The statement is refuted because there is no intersection in the table that matches the criteria of the statement of having the engine type of Ferrari V12s and the driver of Raymond Sommer.
327	Supported. According to the table, out of the top 8 longest marks, 6 of the athletes are from the United States.
328	Supported. According to the table, both Erick Walder and Bob Beamon competed with a wind of 2.0.
329	Supported. According to the table, only three athletes had a mark greater than 29 feet: Mike Powell with 8.95 m (29ft4¼in), Bob Beamon with 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a, and Carl Lewis with 8.87 m (29ft1in).
330	Supported. Bob Beamon set his long jump record on October 18, 1968, while the other records in the table were set on later dates.
331	Supported. According to the table, the most recent record listed is 8.74 m (28ft8in) with a wind of 1.2, which was set by Dwight Phillips in Eugene on June 7, 2009.
332	Refuted. According to the table, five out of the top seven longest marks in the long jump were achieved by athletes from the United States, including the current world record of 8.95 meters by Mike Powell. Therefore, the statement that few athletes from the United States have the longest mark is not supported by the data in the table.
333	Refuted. The wind speeds for the jumps of Eric Walder and Bob Beamon are not the same as those of the other athletes. Eric Walder's jump had a wind speed of 2.0 and Bob Beamon's jump had a wind speed of 2.0 (both marked with an "a" indicating that they were achieved with an assisting wind). All other jumps had wind speeds ranging from 0.2 to 1.9.
334	The statement is refuted by the table. None of the athletes in the table had a mark of 28 feet in the long jump. The closest mark to 28 feet was 8.74 meters (28 feet 8 inches), which was achieved by three different athletes.
335	The statement is refuted by the table. Bob Beamon set his long jump record of 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) on October 18, 1968. This record has stood for over 50 years and has not been broken recently according to the table.
336	The statement "Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record" is refuted by the table. The table provides previously set records by athletes before Dwight Phillips, such as the records held by Mike Powell, Bob Beamon, and Carl Lewis.
337	The statement is supported by the table. Keith Miller, who took 13 wickets, appeared in all 5 matches, while Ernie Toshack, who took 11 wickets, only appeared in 4 matches, as per the table. Therefore, the bowler with 13 wickets appeared in more matches than the bowler with 11 wickets.
338	Supported. According to the table, both Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston took 27 wickets each, but Ray Lindwall had a better bowling average of 19.62 compared to Bill Johnston's 23.33.
339	Supported. According to the table, Bill Johnston took a total of 27 wickets in 5 matches with an average of 23.33, whereas the highest wicket-taker for England, Alec Bedser, took only 18 wickets in the same number of matches. Therefore, none of the England players took as many wickets as Bill Johnston.
340	Supported. According to the table, Jim Laker played in only 3 matches, while all of the Australian players mentioned played in all 5 matches of the 1948 Ashes series.
341	Supported. According to the table, Alec Bedser had an average of 38.22 across 5 matches, which was the best bowling average of any England player listed in the table.
342	Supported. Keith Miller, who had 13 wickets, played in all 5 matches of the series. Ernie Toshack, who had 11 wickets, played in only 4 matches of the series. Therefore, the bowler with 13 wickets appeared in more matches than the bowler with 11 wickets.
343	The statement is refuted because Ray Lindwall had a better bowling average (19.62) compared to Bill Johnston (23.33) despite taking the same number of wickets (27) during the 1948 Ashes series.
344	Refuted. None of the England players listed in the table took as many wickets as Bill Johnston. Bill Johnston and Ray Lindwall both took 27 wickets during the 1948 Ashes series, which was the highest number of wickets taken by any player in that series.
345	Refuted. According to the table, Jim Laker played in only 3 matches, while each of the Australian players (Ray Lindwall, Bill Johnston, Keith Miller, and Ernie Toshack) played in 5 matches. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
346	Supported. According to the table, Dave Sutton played in the df position and scored 6 league goals, which is more than any other df player in the table.

348	Supported. According to the table, Ian Robins has the highest number of league goals with 25, which is more than any other player on the team.
349	Supported. According to the table, Ian Robins scored 27 goals in total, which is the highest number of goals among all the players listed in the table.
350	Supported. According to the table, Peter Hart has 1 FA Cup goal, while all other players listed have 0.
351	Sorry, I cannot determine whether the statement is supported or refuted just by looking at the table. The table only provides data on the number of apps and goals each player has. It doesn't provide data on the number of goals scored by each player based on their position.
352	The statement is refuted. While Chris Topping and Dave Sutton had a significant number of league appearances (46 each), Malcolm Brown had the highest league apps with 46 appearances and one league cup goal.
353	The statement is refuted because according to the table, Tommy Smith did not score any league goals. Peter Fletcher has the highest number of league goals with 17.
354	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Ian Robins has the highest number of total goals with 27, Chris Topping did not score any goals and therefore, does not have the highest number of total goals.
355	Refuted. According to the table, only Peter Hart has scored in the FA Cup, with one goal. No other player has scored in the FA Cup.
356	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played in 5 games with an attendance greater than 50000 in May of the 1991 season, not 8.
357	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played the Rangers on May 1 and May 7 and May 8 during the 1991 season.
358	Supported. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays won two out of the last three games they played in May 1991. They won against the Oakland Athletics on May 29 (8-3) and May 30 (8-6) and lost against the California Angels on May 31 (1-5).
359	The statement is refuted by the table. The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Athletics on May 20 with an attendance of 24,631, not against the Royals.
360	Refuted. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays did not lose three consecutive games between May 25th and May 28th 1991 as they won on May 26th against the Angels.
361	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, there were no games in May of the 1991 season for the Toronto Blue Jays with an attendance lower than 20,000, let alone 5,000. The lowest attendance recorded in the table was 20,809 on May 3rd.
362	Supported. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Angels on May 24th, May 25th, and May 26th during the 1991 season.
363	Supported. According to the table, the Blue Jays played three games in May 1991 after the game on May 28th. They won the game on May 31st against the Angels, but lost the games on May 29th against the Athletics and May 30th against the Athletics. Therefore, the statement that the Toronto Blue Jays lost two of the last three games they played in May 1991 is supported by the table.
364	Incorrect. The table provides no evidence to support or refute the statement because the attendance numbers for the game against the Athletics (May 20) and the game against the Rangers (May 1) are provided, but the attendance of the other games in May are not given. Without the attendance data for the other games, it is impossible to determine which game had the lowest attendance in May.
365	Refuted. According to the table, the Toronto Blue Jays lost on May 25th, May 26th, and May 28th, which are consecutive losses, but they did not lose on May 27th. Therefore, they did not lose one consecutive game between May 25th and May 28th.
366	Supported. According to the table, the tournament on June 2nd, 2003 took place in Surbiton, Great Britain.
367	Supported. The table clearly shows that the tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was on April 16, 2007 (row 6).

375	The statement "rik de voest was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 4, 2011" is supported by the table, as shown in row 7 where Alex Bogdanovic played against Rik De Voest in the Little Rock ATP Challenger tournament, and lost 3-6, 1-6 in straight sets.
376	Supported, because Ben Curtis, J B Holmes, Steve Flesch, and David Toms are all listed as being from the United States in the table.
377	Supported. According to the table, Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, and Charlie Wi is from South Korea.
378	Supported - According to the table, J B Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tied for second place with a score of 209 and a to par of -1.
379	Supported. According to the table, Sergio García, Pádraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi all tied for 4th place with a score of +1 to par.
380	The statement is supported by the table. Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States both tied for 9th place with a score of +3 to par according to the table.
381	Refuted. According to the table, Charlie Wi is from South Korea and Aaron Baddeley is from Australia.
382	The statement is refuted by the table. Henrik Stenson is from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia and Charlie Wi is from South Korea.
383	Sorry, that statement is not accurate. According to the table, J.B. Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tied for second place with a score of 209 and a score to par of -1. They did not tie for third place.
384	Sorry, the statement you provided is inaccurate. Based on the table, Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi actually tied for fourth place with a score of +1 to par, not -1. The statement is refuted by the table.
385	Sorry, the statement is not supported by the table. Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States did not tie for eighth place with +4 to par. They tied for ninth place with +3 to par, along with Aaron Baddeley from Australia and Steve Flesch from the United States.
386	The statement is not supported by the table. The table provides information on the vctp (tank)'s various features, including its weapons systems and specifications such as speed and weight. However, there is no information in the table that conclusively supports or refutes the claim that the vctp 20 mm rh-202 autocannon does not have 75 km/h as the vcrt. The table only provides information on the top speed of the vehicle (75 km/h) and the weapons systems that it carries, but it does not provide any specific details regarding the correlation between the two.
387	Supported. According to the table, the VCA 40t (44.1 tons) has a VCTM of 26t (28.7 tons), and the 155mm (6.1in) L/41 Howitzer has a VCTM of 26t (28.7 tons). Similarly, the 120mm (4.72in) mortar has a VCTM of 26t (28.7 tons).
388	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the "vctp" has a "vca 155" of "40t (44.1tons)" and "18hp/t (16.5hp/ton)", and a speed of "55 km/h (34 mph)". The speed of "75 km/h (47 mph)" belongs to the "vctm" model.
389	The statement is refuted, as according to row 5 of the table, the VCRT for both VCLC and VCPC are listed as 32t, while the VCRT for VCLC is listed as both 160 mm or 350 mm rockets and the VCRT for VCPC is listed as a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. Therefore, the two have different VCRTs.
390	The statement is supported. According to the table, the VCPC and VCRT of the 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun are the same for VCTP 20 mm RH - 202 autocannon, as they are both listed as "-". Similarly, the VCPC and VCRT for VCTP 75 km/h (47 mph) are both listed as "75 km/h (47 mph)".
391	Supported. According to the table, the vctp row lists a 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon, but the vcrt row lists a 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun. Therefore, the vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon does not have 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun as the vcrt.
392	The statement is supported, as the table shows that the VCA 40t (44.1 tons) has a VCTM of 18hp/t (16.5hp/ton), while the 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 Howitzer has a VCTM of 28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton), and the 120 mm (4.72in) Mortar has a VCTM of 28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton). This indicates that the 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 Howitzer has the highest specific power of the three.
393	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the VCTP has a VCA of 155mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer, but the speed of the VCTP is listed as 24hp/t (23hp/ton) and 75 km/h (47 mph). There is no mention of a speed of 55 km/h (34 mph) in the table.
394	The statement is refuted by the table. The table indicates that vclc and vcpc both weigh 32t (35.3 tons) but have different weapons. Vclc has either a 160mm (6.3in) or 350mm (13.8in) rockets, while vcpc has a 7.62mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. However, the table does not provide information about the vcrt of vclc.
395	The statement is partially supported. According to the table, the VCPC and VCRT both have a 7.62 mm FN Mag 60-20 machine gun and both have a maximum speed of 75 km/h (47 mph). However, the VCTP also has a maximum speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), but its armaments include a 20 mm (0.79 in) RH-202 autocannon and a 7.62 mm FN Mag 60-20 machine gun, not VCPC and VCRT.
396	Supported, as the director of "Ballrooms and Biscotti" in the list of "Gilmore Girls" episodes was Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
397	The statement is supported. According to the table, "Ballrooms and Biscotti," "The Hobbit, the Sofa and Digger Stiles," "An Affair to Remember," and "Ted Koppel's Big Night Out" were directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino in 2003.
398	Sorry, but the statement is not supported nor refuted by the table, as it only shows the director, writer(s), original air date, production code, and US viewers (million) of each episode. It does not specify the total number of episodes directed by each individual director.
399	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino did not direct any episodes together. They both separately directed different episodes.
400	Sorry, there is an error in the statement, as episode 69 "Chicken or Beef" actually had 5.5 million viewers and episode 67 "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 3.9 million viewers, which is 1.6 million fewer viewers. Therefore, the statement "number 67 titled the lorelais' first day at yale had 1.6 million less viewers than episode 69 titled chicken or beef?" is supported by the table.
401	The statement is refuted. The writer of the episode "Ballrooms and Biscotti" in the show Gilmore Girls was Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond.
402	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, "Ballrooms and Biscotti" is the first episode of the "Gilmore Girls" series that aired on September 23, 2003, and it was directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino. Therefore, Amy Sherman-Palladino directed a single episode in 2003.
403	Sorry, there seems to be incorrect information in the statement. The table shows that Amy Sherman-Palladino directed only four episodes out of the 21 episodes listed, while Daniel Palladino directed five episodes. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table, and the correct statement is "Amy Sherman-Palladino directed fewer episodes than Daniel Palladino".
404	The statement is unsupported. Although Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino are listed as the writers and directors for multiple episodes in the table, there is no indication in the table that they directed more than three episodes together.
405	Refuted. According to the table, episode 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" had 3.9 million viewers and episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef?" had 5.5 million viewers. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table and is instead refuted by the data provided.

409	Supported. According to the table, both W230AV in Gadsden and W269AX in Anniston have an ERP of 10 watts and a class of D. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
410	Supported. According to the table, both W282AE and W290AG have an ERP of 27 W and a class of D, but W282AE has a city of license of Macon, Georgia, while W290AG has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
411	The statement is refuted by the table. Call sign W230AV has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama, while call sign W269AX has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama.
412	Refuted. According to the table, the frequency for call sign w269ax is 101.7 fm and the frequency for call sign w273ae is 102.5 fm, which are not the same as 93.9 fm and 105.9 fm, respectively.
413	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the city of license for w282ae is Macon, Georgia and the city of license for w290ag is Griffin, Georgia.
414	Supported. The ERP W and class for W230AV in Gadsden, Alabama is 10W and class D according to row 2, while the ERP W and class for W290AG in Griffin, Georgia is also 27W and class D according to row 6. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
415	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the erp w and class for w290ag and w230av are both 10 and D. Additionally, w230av has a city of license of Gadsden, Alabama and w290ag has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia. Therefore, the statement that they have the same ERP and class, and different cities of license is false.
416	Supported. According to the table, both Pakistan and Yemen have won one bronze medal for wushu at the Asian Games, as indicated in row 17 and row 20 respectively.
417	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, China has won 43 gold medals, while Iran has won 4 gold medals, which is a difference of 39 gold medals. Therefore, China has won 39 more gold medals than Iran for wushu at the Asian Games.
418	That statement is supported by the table. According to the table, neither Singapore nor Mongolia has won a gold medal in wushu at the Asian Games, as shown in the gold medal column where both countries have 0 gold medals.
419	Supported. According to the table, the Philippines and Macau have each won one gold and five silver medals in wushu at the Asian Games. However, the Philippines have won 8 bronze medals, while Macau has won 4, which means that the Philippines have won 4 more bronze medals than Macau.
420	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Hong Kong has won a total of 15 medals (2 gold, 9 silver, and 4 bronze), while Thailand has won a total of 11 medals (2 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze). Therefore, Hong Kong has won 4 more total medals than Thailand for wushu.
421	The statement is refuted by the table. Pakistan has won one bronze medal and Yemen has won one bronze medal for wushu at the Asian Games, according to the table.
422	The statement is supported. According to the table, China has won 43 golds while Iran has won only 4 golds, which means that China has won 39 more golds than Iran for wushu at the Asian Games.
423	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Singapore, Mongolia, and Myanmar have not won any gold medals in the wushu events at the Asian Games.
424	Supported. According to the table, the Philippines and Macau both won 1 gold and 5 silver medals for a total of 6 medals each. However, Macau won 4 bronze medals, while the Philippines won 8, making Macau the nation with more bronze medals in the Wushu category.
425	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Hong Kong has won 4 bronze medals more than Thailand. However, the statement says "4 more bronze medals than Thailand," which would imply that Thailand has more bronze medals than Hong Kong, but according to the table, Hong Kong has 4 more bronze medals than Thailand.
426	Supported. According to the table, Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points scored in two games during this period: the March 1 game against Milwaukee (25 points) and the March 10 game against Atlanta (22 points).
427	Supported.
428	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons did not win by over ten points in three games during this period of their 2010-2011 season. The largest margin of victory during this period was a 14-point win over the Toronto Raptors on March 16th, but all the other games were either losses or wins by fewer than 10 points.
429	That statement is supported by the table, as the attendance for the March 1st game against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center is listed as 11,364, which is the lowest attendance listed in the table.
430	That statement is not supported by the table. The table only shows the highest rebounds of each game and does not indicate any ties.
431	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points scored in two games during this period of the 2010-2011 season - on March 1 against Milwaukee (25 points) and on March 10 against Atlanta (22 points).
432	Supported. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons had a record of 26 wins and 47 losses during this period of their 2010-2011 season, meaning they did lose over eight games during this time.
433	That statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Detroit Pistons did not win any game by over ten points during that period of their 2010-2011 season. They had one win against Toronto with a margin of 14 points but no other win had a margin over ten points.
434	Based on the table provided, the statement "the Detroit Pistons had their lowest game attendance during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season on March 20th against Atlanta at the Phillips Arena" cannot be determined as the table only provides attendance numbers for the Pistons' home games at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The attendance number for the game against Atlanta at the Philips Arena is not included in the table, so it's not possible to determine if it was the Pistons' lowest attended game during that period of the season.
435	Actually, the statement is false. According to the table, there were no instances where there was a tie for most rebounds by Detroit Pistons players during this period of the 2010-2011 season. Although there were a few games where multiple players got the same number of rebounds (such as games 62 and 68), there was always one player who had more rebounds than anyone else on the team in each game.
436	Supported. According to the table, episode 4 "All in the Family" had 0.86 million viewers in the US, while episode 2 "Finding Freebo" had 0.79 million viewers in the US. Therefore, episode 4 had more viewers than episode 2.
437	Supported. According to the table, "Our Father" (episode 1) and "All in the Family" (episode 4) were both directed by Keith Gordon during season 3 of Dexter. Therefore, the statement that Keith Gordon directed two episodes of Dexter in season 3 is supported by the table.
438	Supported. The table clearly states that the first episode of season 3 of Dexter, titled "Our Father", aired on September 28, 2008, and the last episode of the season, titled "I Had a Dream", aired on December 7, 2008. Therefore, the statement that season 3 of Dexter aired between September 28 and December 7, 2008, is supported by the table.
439	Supported. According to the table, row 11 shows that the third season of Dexter had a total of 11 episodes.
440	The statement is incorrect as per the provided table. Lauren Gussis is mentioned as a writer for the episode titled "Easy as Pie" in season 3 of Dexter.
441	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the second episode "Finding Freebo" had 0.79 million US viewers, while the fourth episode "All in the Family" had 0.86 million US viewers, meaning that more viewers in the US watched the fourth episode than the second one.
442	Refuted. According to the table, Keith Gordon directed one episode in season 3 of Dexter ("Our Father"), but the "written by" column shows that Clyde Phillips and Adam E Fierro wrote the other two episodes that aired that season ("Finding Freebo" and "All in the Family").
443	Supported. According to the table, the first episode of Dexter Season 3 ("Our Father") aired on September 28, 2008, before October of 2008.
444	Supported. The table shows that there were a total of 12 episodes in the third season of the TV series Dexter, numbered 25 to 35 in the "no in series" column.
445	The statement is refuted by the table. According to row 7 of the table, Lauren Gussis was a writer for the episode "Easy as Pie" of Dexter season 3.
446	I'm sorry, but the given table does not provide information on the results of any election, and therefore I cannot support or refute the given statement. The table only lists the constituencies in the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency, along with the district, reserved status, and number of electorates.
447	Supported, according to the table, Mehgaon had 210649 electorates, which is the highest number compared to all other constituencies listed in the table.
448	Supported. According to the table, the number of electorates in Gohad was 166893 and in Bhander was 139600. Therefore, Gohad had 36732 more electorates than Bhander.
449	Supported. According to the table, the constituency of Sewda had the lowest number of electorates in 2009, with a total of 130,161.
450	The statement is refuted by the table. While Goahd's constituency number is 13, Datia's constituency number is 22. Therefore, Datia's constituency number is actually higher than Goahd's by 9.
451	I'm sorry but the provided table for the Bhind (Lok Sabha Constituency) doesn't have any information related to the results of an election. The table just provides information about constituency number, name, reservation status, district, and the number of electorates for each individual constituency. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the statement "the results were counted in bhind district three times and five times in datia" is supported or refuted by this table.
452	Sorry, the statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, in 2009, Mehgaon had 210,649 electorates, while Datia had 143,593 electorates. So, in fact, Mehgaon had the highest number of electorates in 2009 out of all the constituencies listed in the table.
453	Refuted. According to the table, Gohad had 166,893 electorates while Bhander had 139,600. Therefore, Gohad had 27,293 more electorates than Bhander, not 16,732.
454	Supported. According to the table, the number of electorates in Sewda was 130161, which is lower than all the other constituencies listed in the table except for Ater constituency with 177334 electorates. Therefore, Sewda had the second-lowest number of electorates in 2009.
455	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the constituency number for Gohad is 13, while the constituency number for Datia is 22, which means that Datia's constituency number is actually higher than Gohad's by 9.
456	Sorry, but the statement "25 - 26 january 2003 and 12 - 13 july 2003 were the only games played in 2003" cannot be supported or refuted by the given table about Tsuyoshi Fujita. The table only shows the events that Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in, not all the games he played in each season.
457	Supported. According to the table, Tsuyoshi Fujita only participated in one invitational event, which was in the 2005 season in Los Angeles, as stated in the statement.
458	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the only season that included events in the Standard format was 2002-03, with one Grand Prix held in Bangkok. Seasons 2001-02 and 2003-04 included events in Limited, Extended, Special, and Team Limited formats, but not in Standard format.
459	The statement is refuted by the table. The table does not have any information about "season 5," and the locations of the events listed in the table do not match with Los Angeles and London being the last two games in any specific season. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the statement based on the given table.
460	Supported. According to the table, there was only one event in 2011 which was the pro tour in Nagoya and it took place on June 10-12, 2011.
461	Sorry, but the statement "25 - 26 January 2003 was the only game played in 2003" cannot be determined from the given table about Tsuyoshi Fujita. The table only provides information on the various Magic: The Gathering events that Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in from 1997 to 2011, including the event type, location, format, date, and rank. There is no information about the games played or not played in any particular year.
462	The statement "the only invitational event type was in the 2002 season in Los Angeles" is refuted by the table because there was also an invitational event in 2005 in Los Angeles, as shown in row 19.
463	Supported. Seasons 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04 in the table about Tsuyoshi Fujita were all in the limited format, as indicated in rows 9, 13, 14, and 17.
464	I'm sorry, but the table does not support the statement that the last 4 games in season 5 were held in Los Angeles and London. The table only includes information about Tsuyoshi Fujita's performances in various Magic: The Gathering tournaments, and none of the events listed in Season 5 took place in London or had more than one location.
465	The statement is refuted. According to the table, there was only one event Tsuyoshi Fujita participated in during 2011, which was the Pro Tour in Nagoya on June 10-12, 2011. Therefore, there were not ten events in 2011.
466	Supported. According to the table, three episodes aired in January (episodes 1, 2, and 3), while only two episodes aired in February (episodes 5 and 6).
467	Supported. According to the table, there are five episodes that aired in March, which are episodes 7-11. No other month has as many episodes that aired.
468	Supported - according to the table, there is one episode ("Fathers and Sons") that was directed by Mike Clattenburg, and another episode ("Duchess of George") that was also directed by Mike Clattenburg. Therefore, there were two episodes in the series that were directed by Mike Clattenburg.
469	Supported, as per the table there are three directors who directed two episodes: Mike Clattenburg, Steve Dimarco, and Robert Lieberman.
470	Sorry, I cannot perform this task as the table only contains two episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg and one episode directed by Steve Scaini.
471	Supported - According to the given table, there are 3 episodes that aired in February (episodes 5, 6, and 7) and only 2 episodes that aired in January (episodes 1 and 2).
472	Supported. According to the table, there were 5 episodes aired in the month of January (Episodes 1-3, 5, and 6), which is the most episodes aired in any month.
473	The statement is refuted by the table because according to the table, there was no episode in the series that was directed by Perry Chafe. All the episodes were directed by Mike Clattenburg, Steve DiMarco, Larry McLean, Robert Lieberman, Jerry Ciccoritti, and Steve Scaini.
474	Supported. According to the table, each episode was directed by a different person. There is no repetition of a director's name in the "directed by" column. Therefore, the statement that there were no directors that directed more than one episode is supported.
475	Refuted. The table shows that Mike Clattenburg directed three episodes ("Fathers and Sons" - episode 1, "Duchess of George" - episode 3, and "The Tell-Tale Safe" - episode 8) while Steve Scaini directed only one episode ("A Horse Divided" - episode 11). Therefore, the statement that Steve Scaini directed one more episode than Mike Clattenburg is refuted by the table.
476	Supported. According to the table, Carlos Cuéllar's transfer fee was 7.8 million, which was the highest transfer fee among all the players listed in the table.
477	Supported. According to the table, there were a total of 22 transfers involving players from Rangers F.C. during the 2008-09 season that either came or went to a Scottish team (marked "sco" in the table), while there were only 11 transfers that involved players moving to or from teams outside of Scotland. This means that the total number of transfers within Scotland was higher than the number of transfers to and from teams outside Scotland, and therefore, sco had the highest number of transfers at 22, which is more than every other team combined.
478	The statement is refuted. While some players did move to new teams after the end of their contracts (Nicholas Gallacher, Lacine Cherif, Alistair Park, Michael Donald, Calum Reidford, Chris Smith, and Jeroen van den Broeck), there were also transfers, loans, or free agent signings for other players throughout both the summer and winter transfer windows.
479	Supported. According to the table, Chris Burke had a transfer to Cardiff City and the transfer fee is listed as "free". Therefore, he is indeed the only player on the table who had a transfer with a free transfer fee.
480	Supported. According to the table, there were 19 players transferred during the summer window, indicated by the "transfer" type and "summer" transfer window, while there were only 3 players transferred during the winter window, indicated by "transfer" or "loan" type and "winter" transfer window. Therefore, the statement that nineteen players were transferred during the summer window as opposed to six during the winter window is supported by the table.
481	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that Carlos Cuéllar had a transfer fee of 7.8 million, which was the only fee listed in the table and therefore the lowest.
482	Refuted. The table only lists the transfers made by Rangers F.C. during the 2008-2009 season, and while it includes the nationality of each player, it does not include a total count of the number of transfers from each country. Therefore, it is impossible to determine from this table which country had the lowest amount of transfers.
483	Supported. According to the table, players Nicholas Gallacher, Lacine Cherif, Alistair Park, Michael Donald, Calum Reidford, Chris Smith, and Jeroen van den Broeck all moved to another team at the end of their contract (marked "end of contract" in the "type" column). Additionally, loaned players Steven Lennon, Mark Weir, Andy Webster, Alan Gow, Lee Robinson, Andrew Shinnie, Steven Kinniburgh, Georgios Efrem, Alan Gow, Charlie Adam, Ross Harvey, and Steven Kinniburgh were listed as "n/a" in the "transfer fee" column, suggesting that they were transferred at the end of their contract. This adds up to a total of ten players transferred at the end of their contract.
484	Supported, as indicated on row 29, Chris Burke's transfer to Cardiff City was marked with a free transfer fee.
485	Supported. According to the table, there were 19 transfers listed in the summer window and only 4 transfers listed in the winter window. Therefore, 15 players were transferred during the summer window as opposed to only 8 during the winter window.
486	Supported, because Melbourne had the lowest score of all away teams with 8.10 (58) during the 1972 VFL season based on the given table.
487	Supported. According to the table, the crowd size for the Collingwood vs Melbourne game was 30,883, which is the largest crowd size across all the games listed.
488	Refuted. According to the given table, the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was 7,007, while the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game was 22,251, therefore the statement is not true.
489	Refuted. The average of all the home team scores is not 15.67. Calculating the average of the home team scores using the data in the table, we get:(91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73)/6 = 620/6 = 103.33Therefore, the statement "the average of all the home team scores is 15.67" is refuted by the table.
490	Refuted. Based on the table, only 2 out of 6 away teams had a score greater than 10, which is not equal to 1/3.
491	Supported. According to the table, Melbourne had a score of 8.10 (58) when playing as the away team, which was indeed the second lowest score across all the away teams.
492	Refuted. According to the table, the Collingwood vs Melbourne game had a crowd size of 30,883, but there is no information about the crowd size in the other games. Therefore, we cannot determine whether it had the third largest crowd size.
493	Supported. According to the table, the attendance at Fitzroy vs North Melbourne was 7007 while the attendance at Essendon vs Richmond was 22,251. Therefore, the statement is false, and is refuted by the table.
494	Refuted. The average of all the home team scores is actually higher than 12. To calculate the average of all the home team scores, we first need to find the total of all the home team scores. By adding the scores in row 2 to 7, we get:14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13 = 93.9Next, we divide the total by the number of games played (which is 6) to get the average:93.9 / 6 = 15.65Therefore, the average of all the home team scores is actually 15.65, which is higher than 12.
495	Refuted. Only 2 out of the 6 away teams had a score greater than 10 (North Melbourne with 9.12 and Geelong with 15.8). This is less than half of the total away teams.
496	I'm sorry but the statement "the agricultural panel and labour panel both have 11 total members" is refuted by the table. The agricultural panel has a total of 11 members whereas the labour panel has only 5 members.
497	Supported. Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, which is 18 more members than Clann na Talmhan, the party with the fewest total members, which has only 3 members.
498	Refuted. According to the table, there were 0 members from the University of Dublin group who were made up entirely of members from one party. The University of Dublin had 3 members in total, but none of them belonged to a single party.
499	The table shows that the statement "nominated by the taoiseach has the most members from one party" is supported. According to the table, 11 members of the 5th Seanad were nominated by the taoiseach, which is the highest number of members from one party.
500	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table as it only provides the number of members from each party in each of the panels and universities, rather than a breakdown of each panel's individual members.
501	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the agricultural panel has 2 members from Fine Gael and 2 members from Clann na Talmhan, which adds up to a total of 4 members. Similarly, the labour panel has 5 members from the Labour Party, which is also confirmed by the table.
502	Supported. According to the table, Fianna Fáil has a total of 21 members, while Fine Gael has only 9 members, which is a difference of 12, but the statement only requires a difference of 9 or more. Therefore, the statement is supported.
503	Refuted. According to the table, the National University of Ireland senators had only one member from Fianna Fáil, one member from Fine Gael, and one member nominated by the Taoiseach. The majority of their members (three out of four) were not affiliated with any particular party and are therefore considered independent. This disproves the statement that the National University of Ireland is made up mostly of members from two parties.
504	Based on the table, the statement "agricultural panel has the most members from one party" is supported. The Fianna Fáil party has 4 members in the administrative panel, 4 members in the agricultural panel, 2 members in the cultural and educational panel, 3 members in the industrial and commercial panel, and 0 members in the labour panel. This totals to 11 members, which is the highest number of members from one party in any panel.
505	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Administrative panel has seven members, while the National University of Ireland has only one member. Therefore, the Administrative panel has six more members than the National University of Ireland, not four.
506	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, ASC Diaraf won the first leg 3-0 against Stade Malien, but lost the second leg 0-4, resulting in an overall aggregate score of 3-4 in favor of Stade Malien. Therefore, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
507	I'm sorry, but the statement is not supported by the table. The table only shows the scores and results for the first and second legs of the matches played during the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. It does not indicate the total points or standings of the teams in the tournament. Therefore, there is no information in the table to support or refute the statement that "the young africans scored two points in the 1971 african cup of champions clubs".
508	Supported. According to the table, Secteur 6 lost to Enugu Rangers with an aggregate score of 1-2, which means they lost the second leg 0-1 after a 1-1 draw in the first leg.
509	Supported. According to the table, As Porto Novo scored no points in both legs of their match against Victoria Club Mokanda, with a score of 0-1 in the first leg and 0-2 in the second leg.
510	Sorry, I made a mistake in my previous message. The table about "1971 african cup of champions clubs" is "row 1: team 1| agg| team 2| 1st leg| 2nd leg; row 2: al - merrikh| 2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)| tele sc asmara| 2 - 1| 0 - 1; row 3: abaluhya united| 1 - 3| great olympics| 0 - 0| 1 - 3; row 4: asc diaraf| 3 - 4| stade malien| 3 - 0| 0 - 4; row 5: maseru united| 3 - 5| mmm tamatave| 1 - 2| 2 - 3; row 6: as porto novo| 0 - 3| victoria club mokanda| 0 - 1| 0 - 2; row 7: canon yaoundé| 9 - 4| as solidarité| 7 - 3| 2 - 1; row 8: espérance| 1 - 0| al - ahly (benghazi)| 0 - 0| 1 - 0; row 9: secteur 6| 1 - 2| enugu rangers| 1 - 1| 0 - 1; row 10: young africans| 2 - 0| lavori publici| 2 - 0| 0 - 0;". The statement is "canon yaoundé scored five more goals than their opponent".
511	The statement is refuted by the table. According to row 4 of the table, ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien with a total aggregate score of 3-4 across the two legs. Therefore, ASC Diaraf did not win against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
512	The statement is supported by the table. Young Africans won both legs of their match against Lavori Publici 2-0, resulting in a total score of 4-0 and giving them 2 points in the tournament. Therefore, they did not score zero points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
513	Supported. According to the table, Secteur 6 scored 1 goal against Enugu Rangers' 1 goal during the 1st leg, and Enugu Rangers scored 1 goal against Secteur 6's 0 goals during the 2nd leg, resulting in Secteur 6 winning with a final score of 1-2.
514	I'm sorry, I cannot support or refute the statement as the table does not contain information about points, only information on the scores of each leg and the aggregate score.
515	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Canon Yaoundé scored a total of 9 goals against their opponent, AS Solidarité, winning the match with a combined score of 9-4. Therefore, Canon Yaoundé did not score zero points against their opponent.
516	Supported. The highest attendance recorded in the table is 54137 during the game against the Dodgers on September 7, while the lowest attendance is 22616 during the game against the Giants on September 16. The difference between the two attendance numbers is indeed 31521 people (54137 - 22616 = 31521).
517	Supported. According to the table, the Giants played a total of four games against the Diamondbacks and four games against the Rockies, all within the month of September. This amounts to a total of eight games, so the statement that the Giants played seven games is false.
518	The statement is refuted because no game had a score of more than 10 points in the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season table.
519	The statement is refuted by the table because the table indicates that there was no player named Rosales who took a loss during any game in September.
520	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, there was only one game with an attendance of over 50000, which was on September 5 against the Dodgers with a recorded attendance of 52270.
521	The statement is not supported by the table. The average attendance during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season cannot be calculated from the information provided in the table as it only provides the attendance for each individual game, not the cumulative total or an average.
522	Refuted. According to the table, both the Giants and Cardinals played 9 games in the month of September.
523	The statement is refuted by the table as there are only two games that had a score higher than 10 points: the September 21 game against the Rockies with a score of 13-4 and the September 25 game against the Cardinals with a score of 12-3.
524	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Johnson had 10 losses (row 22) while Rosales had only 1 loss (row 24). Therefore, Rosales has fewer losses than Johnson.
525	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against the Dodgers on September 5 was 52270, which is the highest attendance listed in the table.
526	Refuted. According to the table, the highest combined agg score of any of the featured games was in the match between CD Elá Nguema and Primeiro de Agosto, with a total agg score of 8 (2-6 in favor of CD Elá Nguema in the first leg, and 0-3 in favor of Primeiro de Agosto in the second leg). Saint-Louis FC's game against Young Africans had a combined agg of 9 (2-7 in favor of Young Africans), which is higher than the CD Elá Nguema - Primeiro de Agosto game, but not the highest overall.
527	Supported. According to the table, in the 4th game, CD Elá Nguema played against Primeiro de Agosto with an aggregate score of 2-6 (2-3 in the first leg and 0-3 in the second leg), while in the 6th game, ASC Police played against AS Real Bamako with an aggregate score of 2-2 (1-1 in both the first and second legs). Therefore, the 4th game had a higher total score than the 6th game.
528	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, only one game had a score of 0 - 0 for the 1st leg, which was between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia.
529	Sorry, but the table doesn't provide information about any match between "botswana defence force xi" and "arsenal (maseru)". Therefore, it is impossible to support or refute the statement.
530	Supported. The table shows that the Botswana Defence Force XI had a score of 1 - 1 in their first leg and the ASC Police had a score of 1 - 1 in their first leg as well.
531	Sorry about that, but I wasn't able to process your request earlier. Based on the table, the statement "the game between team 1 saint - louis fc and team 2 eleven arrows fc has the highest combined agg compared to any featured games" is refuted. The game between Saint-Louis FC and Young Africans has the highest combined agg (2-7) compared to any featured games, while the game between Saint-Louis FC and Eleven Arrows FC has a combined agg of 2-1, which is one of the lower combined agg scores in the table.
532	The statement is refuted, as the scores for LPRC Oilers versus Mighty Blackpool are higher than the scores for Port Autonome versus Sporting Clube da Praia.
533	The statement is refuted by the table because there is only one game and two legs that has the score of 0 - 0 in the table, which is row 7 between Port Autonome and Sporting Clube da Praia.
534	Yes, that statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Botswana Defence Force XI had an agg of 1-2 across both legs of their match against Mbabane Highlanders, giving them the lowest agg of all the teams that competed in the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
535	The statement is unclear. Can you please rephrase it or provide more context?
536	The statement "Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games two times" is supported by the table, as rows 8 and 10 of the table show that he competed in the Olympic Games twice, in 2008 and 2012.
537	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich placed 3rd in the World Championships in Moscow in 2013, which is higher than the third place or higher mentioned in the statement.
538	The statement is supported by the table. Lukáš Melich competed in two junior championships according to the table - the World Junior Championships in 1998 where he finished 10th and the European Junior Championships in 1999 where he finished 5th.
539	The statement is refuted by the table. Lukáš Melich competed in 3 worldwide championships out of 10 - the World Junior Championships in 1998, the World Championships in 2005, and the Olympic Games in 2008.
540	Supported. In Lukáš Melich's last two competitions (2012 Olympic Games and 2013 World Championships), his throws were 77.17 m and 79.36 m, respectively. The average of these two distances is 78.27 m.
541	The statement "Lukáš Melich won a medal at the Olympic Games" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's best performance at the Olympic Games was finishing 6th in 2012 with a throw of 77.17m. He did not win a medal in any of the Olympic Games he competed in.
542	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich's best finish was third in the World Championships in Moscow in 2013, where he achieved a distance of 79.36 m.
543	The statement is refuted by the table. While Lukáš Melich did have a 5th place finish as a junior in the 1999 European Junior Championships, he later achieved a 3rd place finish in the 2013 World Championships, which is higher than any finish he had as a junior.
544	The statement is refuted by the table. Although there are several world championships listed in the table, only two of them were senior world championships (2005 and 2009).
545	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Lukáš Melich threw for 79.36 m during the 2013 World Championships, which is greater than 78 m.
546	The statement is refuted by the table. Hawthorn scored 6.13 (49), which is less than 10, but South Melbourne scored 8.8 (56), which is not less than 10. Therefore, the statement is not accurate.
547	Refuted. According to the table, only one home team, North Melbourne, scored less than 11 points with a total score of 71, while all the other home teams scored more than 11 points.
548	Supported. According to the table, Carlton scored 16.25 (121) points in their match on June 18th, which was the highest score among all the matches that were played on that day.
549	Supported. According to the table, the game with the highest attendance was between Richmond and Essendon, which had a crowd of 20,000. However, this was still less than "more than 20,000", so the statement is supported by the table.
550	Supported. According to the table, Geelong scored 11.23 (89) while Hawthorn scored 6.13 (49), Fitzroy scored 16.12 (108) while South Melbourne scored 8.8 (56), and Richmond scored 15.14 (104) while Essendon scored 15.9 (99). In all three games, the home team had a higher score than the away team.
551	The statement is refuted by the table. As per the table, three teams i.e. Melbourne, Essendon, and Carlton, scored more than 10 points during the 1938 VFL season.
552	The statement is refuted by the table. While the first row shows the home team Geelong scoring 11.23 (89), the other home teams did not score less than 11. Fitzroy scored 16.12 (108), St Kilda scored 14.12 (96), Richmond scored 15.14 (104), Footscray scored 13.9 (87), and North Melbourne scored 11.5 (71). Therefore, the statement is not accurate.
553	The statement is supported. Although Carlton lost their game against North Melbourne, they scored a total of 121 points, which is the second highest score among all the teams that played on the 18th of June in the 1938 VFL season.
554	The statement is refuted by the table. The game between Geelong and Hawthorn, held at Corio Oval on 18 June 1938, had a crowd of 7000, which is fewer than 20000.
555	The statement is refuted. None of the home teams in the table had the same score as the away team that they were playing. The closest scores were when Richmond had a score of 104, while Essendon had a score of 99, but Richmond was still the winner.
556	Supported. According to the table, Alberto Pagani has only won with two teams, Linto and MV Agusta. In 1969, he won with Linto in the 500cc class, and in 1971, he won with both Linto and MV Agusta in the 500cc class.
557	Refuted, because Alberto Pagani won in both the 500cc and 500cc class.
558	The statement is supported by the table. In 1971, Alberto Pagani won in two different classes - 500cc on Linto and 500cc on MV Agusta, with one win each. This is the only year where he won twice in the same year.
559	I'm sorry, but I cannot support or refute the statement "alberto pagani averages 40 points in races he wins" based on the given table. The table only provides the number of points and wins for each year, but it does not break down the points or wins by race. Additionally, there is no information on the total number of races Pagani may have won throughout his career.
560	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Pagani has raced for Aermacchi eight times, there are two instances in which he raced for teams (Honda and Linto) more than once, so those teams tie with Aermacchi in terms of the number of races Pagani participated in for them.
561	The statement is refuted, as Alberto Pagani won with three teams: Linto, MV Agusta, and Honda. While he did win with Linto and MV Agusta before 1967, he also won with Honda in 1962.
562	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Alberto Pagani won a total of 3 races, one in the 500cc class and two in the 500cc class with Linto and MV Agusta respectively. His average points across all classes is 5.1, which is much lower than the stated average of 87.
563	The statement is refuted by the table. While Alberto Pagani raced in the 250cc class in 1971, according to the table, he did not win any races in that class that year. Therefore, he did not win two times in the same year in the 250cc class in 1971.
564	Unfortunately, I can neither support nor refute the statement "Alberto Pagani averages 40 points in races he wins in the 250cc class" through the provided table. This is because Pagani did not win any races in the 250cc class.
565	Refuted. According to the table, Alberto Pagani has raced for Aermacchi five times, not ten, and he did not win any of those races.
566	Supported. According to the table, during the 1993 New York Jets season, the New York Jets played eight games, and six of those games were played at "the meadowlands" game site.
567	This statement is incorrect. The table about the 1993 New York Jets season shows that only three games had an attendance of over 70000, while none had an attendance of over 71000. Therefore, the statement "six games had an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 New York Jets season" is refuted by the table.
568	Refuted - The New York Jets won 8 games and lost 8 games during the 1993 season. Therefore, they did not take the same amount of wins as losses.
569	Supported. According to the table, the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1 on September 5, 1993, while they played the Miami Dolphins in Week 2 on September 12, 1993. Therefore, the Jets played the Broncos before the Dolphins during the 1993 season.
570	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the Jets' first game against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1 was 68130, while the attendance for their second game against the Dolphins in Week 10 was 71306. Therefore, there were 992 more people in attendance for the second game against the Miami Dolphins compared to the first game against them during the 1993 season.
571	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the New York Jets played one game at the game site named the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium during the 1993 NFL season, which was in week 15 against the Washington Redskins.
572	The statement is refuted as only four games had an attendance of over 70000 during the 1993 New York Jets season. These games were against the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, Washington Redskins, and Dallas Cowboys, as shown in rows 3, 7, 14, and 15 of the table.
573	The statement is supported by the table. The New York Jets won 8 games (Weeks 2,4,9,10,11,13,14,15) and lost 8 games (Weeks 1,5,6,8,12,16,17,18) during the 1993 season, which means they have three more wins than losses.
574	Refuted. According to the table, the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos first in week 1 on September 5th, 1993 and then played the Miami Dolphins in week 2 on September 12th, 1993. Therefore, the statement is refuted.
575	Refuted. The table shows that the Jets played against the New England Patriots twice during the 1993 season, with the first game held on September 26 and the second on November 28. The attendance for the first game was 64,836, while the attendance for the second game was 42,810. Therefore, the second game had 22,026 fewer people in attendance than the first game.
576	Supported. According to the table, Brian Sipe started in 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started in 105 games. Therefore, Brian Sipe started seven more games than Bernie Kosar.
577	Supported. According to the table, quarterbacks George Ratterman, Don Strock, and Brian Hoyer have two different uniform numbers listed next to their names (numbers 12 and 16, 12 and 18, and 6 and 7, respectively).
578	Supported. According to the table, the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of 10 games (ties column) across all the starting quarterbacks listed.
579	Supported. According to the table, only 10 quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns have won more than 10 games as a starter.
580	Supported. According to the table, Otto Graham started in 71 games and had 57 wins, 13 losses, and 1 tie. Therefore, he won 44 more games than he lost.
581	Supported. According to the table, Brian Sipe started in 112 games, while Bernie Kosar started in 105 games, which means that Sipe started in eight more games than Kosar.
582	Supported. According to the table, four starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns have two different uniform numbers - George Ratterman (12 and 16), Babe Parilli (18), Ken Dorsey (11), and Don Lane (15).
583	Supported. According to the table, the Cleveland Browns have tied a total of 12 games.
584	Supported. According to the table, there are only 10 quarterbacks on the list who have won more than 30 games: Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar, Frank Ryan, Otto Graham, Tim Couch, Bill Nelsen, Milt Plum, Derek Anderson, Vinny Testaverde, and Jeff Garcia.
585	Supported. According to the table, Otto Graham has won 57 games while Brady Quinn has won only 3 games. Therefore, Otto Graham has won 54 more games than Brady Quinn.
586	That statement is supported by the table. All players finished at even par or above, with the lowest score being 70 (which was even par for the course). Therefore, no player finished under par during the 1981 Open Championship.
587	Refuted. According to the table, there were only seven players who tied for 9th place in the 1981 Open Championship.
588	Supported. According to the table, there were five players from both England and the United States who participated in the 1981 Open Championship, which means that the statement is supported by the table.
589	The statement is refuted by the table. The winning score for the 1981 Open Championship was actually 70, as two players, Vicente Fernández from Argentina and Nick Job from England, tied for first place with a score of even par (E). The score of 72 was not the winning score, but instead, eight players tied for ninth place with a score of +2 (two over par).
590	Supported. According to the table, there were ties in the first and second positions (Vicente Fernández and Nick Job both scored 70), as well as in the third position with Isao Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, and Hal Sutton (who was an amateur) all scoring 71. Similarly, there was a tie in the ninth position with Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, and Sam Torrance all finishing with a score of 72. Therefore, every position on the leaderboard had at least two players tied for that position.
591	The statement is refuted by the table. While it is true that Isao Aoki finished with a score of -1 (which means he finished under par), it is not true that no other player finished under par. Vicente Fernández and Nick Job finished with a score of even par (E), which means they finished on par or under par for the tournament.
592	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that there were seven players who tied for 3rd place and eight players who tied for 9th place in the 1981 Open Championship.
593	Supported. The table shows that England, Australia, and the United States each had five players compete in the 1981 Open Championship, which confirms that they had the same number of players in the tournament.
594	The statement is refuted by the table. While there were several players who scored 72 and tied for ninth place, the winning score was actually 70, with Vicente Fernández of Argentina and Nick Job of England tying for first place with that score.
595	Supported. Only one player, Vicente Fernández from Argentina, achieved their position alone at the 1981 Open Championship with a score of 70, which tied him with Nick Job from England. All other positions had multiple players tied for the same score, indicating no one achieved their position alone.
596	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played against the Padres on September 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is a total of four times during the 2005 season.
597	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played the San Diego Padres on September 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then played the Cincinnati Reds on September 5, 6, and 7.
598	The statement is refuted by the table. There is only one game in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season in which one team scored no points, which is the game against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 25th.
599	The statement is refuted by the table. The Milwaukee Brewers played the Reds on September 5, 6, 7, 26, 27, 28, and 29, but they played the Cardinals on September 23, 24, and 25, three days after their last game against the Reds.
600	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, only 3 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season had an attendance of more than 30000 people (September 3 versus Padres, September 17 versus Astros, and September 24 versus Cardinals).
601	Supported. According to the table, the Cubs were the opponent of the Milwaukee Brewers four times during the 2005 season.
602	Supported. According to the table, the Milwaukee Brewers played the Padres on September 1, 2, 3, and 4. They then played the Reds on September 5, 6, and 7. They played the Astros on September 9, 10, and 11, which is after their series with the Padres.
603	This statement is refuted by the table. There is only one game in the table where one team scored no points (Cardinals vs Brewers on September 25, 2005).
604	The table shows no mention of the Yankees, therefore the statement is refuted. The Milwaukee Brewers did not play the Yankees in the 2005 season according to the given table.
605	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the highest attendance for a game during the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season was 37756 and the lowest attendance was 13173. The statement claims that every game was attended by more than 30000 people, but there were several games with attendance below that number.
606	Supported. According to the table, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists in three out of the seven games listed (games 4, 5, and 7), while Deron Williams only led in assists in two games (games 1 and 2). Therefore, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did.
607	Supported. According to the table, Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three times during the season: on April 5th against Minnesota, he scored 30 points and had 12 rebounds; on April 6th against Detroit, he scored 39 points and had 7 rebounds; and on April 8th against New York, he scored 27 points and had 9 rebounds.
608	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that the New Jersey Nets had only one win during the 2010-11 season, which was against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was played at the Prudential Center. Therefore, the statement that "the nets' only win came at the prudential center" is supported by the table.
609	Supported. According to the table "2010 - 11 new jersey nets season", Brook Lopez was the highest scorer for the New Jersey Nets in games 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81 consecutively, implying that he led the team in points for 5 straight games.
610	That statement is refuted by the table. The game against Miami at the Prudential Center had an attendance of 18,711, while the game against Philadelphia at the Wells Fargo Center had an attendance of 16,695, which is lower. Therefore, the most highly attended game was against Philadelphia, not Miami.
611	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Deron Williams led the team in assists for 3 out of the 7 games listed (games 75, 76, and 78) while Brook Lopez only led the team in assists once (game 77). Therefore, Deron Williams led the team in assists for a greater number of games than Brook Lopez did.
612	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Travis Outlaw did not lead the team in both points and rebounds in any of the listed games. In fact, in the game against Miami on April 3, 2011, he only recorded 4 points and 1 rebound. Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds in 4 out of the 7 listed games.
613	Supported. According to the table, the Nets' one and only win during the 2010-11 season was on April 5th against the Minnesota Timberwolves, which was held at the Prudential Center. The statement is false.
614	Refuted, according to the table, although Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for three straight games, he did not lead the team in points for any of the listed games.
615	Sorry. The statement is actually "The New Jersey Nets won more games than they lost during the 2010-11 season."
616	Supported. According to the table, Mark Brooks earned $430,000, which is the highest amount of money earned among all players listed.
617	The statement is supported because Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both had a score of 277 and a to par score of -11, which was the lowest to par across all the players in the table.
618	Supported. According to the table, there is only one player from Zimbabwe listed in the table, which is Nick Price.
619	Supported. According to the table, only Frank Nobilo is listed as a player from New Zealand who participated in the 1996 PGA Championship.
620	Sorry, I made a mistake earlier. The correct answer for the East Kent Mavericks example was "supported". Regarding the statement "Kenny Perry earned 170000 less than Mark Brooks" from the table on the "1996 PGA Championship," the answer is "refuted." According to the table, Mark Brooks earned $430,000 for his win, while Kenny Perry earned $260,000 for his second-place finish. Therefore, Kenny Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks.
621	Refuted. The player who earned the most money in the 1996 PGA Championship was Mark Brooks, who finished in first place with a score of 277 and earned a prize money of $430,000. Kenny Perry finished in second place with the same score of 277 and earned a prize money of $260,000.
622	That statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both finished with a score of 277 and a to par score of -11. They tied for first place in the tournament.
623	The statement is refuted by the table. While Phil Mickelson is indeed a player from the United States, he is not the only player from the United States to participate in the 1996 PGA Championship. There are other United States players as well, such as Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Steve Elkington, Tommy Tolles, Justin Leonard, Lee Janzen, and Larry Mize.
624	Refuted. The table provides information about the top players of the 1996 PGA Championship and their scores, countries and money received. However, it does not provide information about the exclusive representation of Zimbabwe in the competition. Therefore, it cannot be concluded from this table whether Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe or not.
625	Sorry, but that statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Mark Brooks won the tournament with a score of 277, while Kenny Perry finished in second place with the same score of 277. However, Brooks won more money than Perry, earning $430,000 compared to Perry's $260,000. Therefore, Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks, not more.

629	Supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 861 chassis was used in the years 1986 and 1987, as shown in rows 3 and 4 of the table.
630	Supported. The table shows that for the years 1985 to 1988, all the chassis used the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine.
631	Supported. According to the table, the Zakspeed 891 chassis was equipped with a Yamaha V8 engine. However, the table doesn't mention if there were multiple engines, so the statement would still be technically correct if it only said "the zakspeed 891 chassis has a yamaha v8 engine."
632	Supported. According to the table, the chassis for the year 1985 was only the zakspeed 841. There is no mention of any other chassis for that year.
633	The statement is "there were more than two zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987". This statement is refuted by the table as it shows that there were only two zakspeed chassis made in 1987, the zakspeed 861 and the zakspeed 871.
634	Supported. According to the table, the zakspeed 861 chassis was used in both 1986 and 1987, as seen in rows 3 and 4.
635	Supported. Flamengo and Fluminense hold the first two positions with 13 points each, making them tied for first place.
636	Supported. According to the table, Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points, but Flamengo has a goal difference of 8 while Fluminense has a goal difference of 10, which separates them in the table even though they have the same number of points.
637	Supported. According to the table, there are four teams with a negative goal difference: Portuguesa, Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, and América. Additionally, there are only four teams with a positive goal difference: Flamengo, Fluminense, Corinthians, and Palestra Itália. Therefore, the statement that "four of the teams have a minus goal difference while only four have scored more goals than those against them" is supported by the table.
638	Sorry, I need to correct my previous message. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to interpret images or access external links. If you could provide me with the table in text format, I can definitely assist you in determining whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
639	Supported. According to the table, Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points, while Corinthians has 9 points. However, Flamengo has a goal difference of 8, Fluminense has a goal difference of 5, and Corinthians has a goal difference of 4, which means that Flamengo is ranked first, followed by Fluminense and then Corinthians. Therefore, three teams did tie on points but were separated by goal difference.
640	Sorry, the statement is refuted. According to the table, both Flamengo and Fluminense had the same amount of points, 13, and therefore did not have a different amount of points.
641	The statement is supported by the table as Fluminense, the second team, has 13 points and Flamengo, the first team, also has 13 points but with a better goal difference of +8, which is a two goal difference compared to Fluminense's goal difference of +5.
642	Supported. Only two teams in the table have a minus goal difference: Portuguesa and América. Meanwhile, five teams have had more goals scored against them than they have scored themselves: Portuguesa, Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, América, and São Paulo.
643	Sorry, I'm not able to do web search as it's beyond my capabilities as a language model AI. However, after analyzing the table, the statement "over three teams have the same number of goals scored against them" is not supported, as no more than two teams in the table have the same number of goals scored against them.
644	Supported. According to the table, none of the teams tied on points, as Flamengo and Fluminense both had 13 points but Flamengo had a better goal difference. Additionally, the goal differences between teams were all greater than 1 (ranging from 3 to 13), indicating that most teams were separated by more than 1 goal difference.
645	Supported. According to the table, in the 1954 VFL season, Collingwood's home team score was 12.16 (88) when they played against South Melbourne at Victoria Park. Geelong's home team score, on the other hand, was 13.12 (90) when they played against Hawthorn at Kardinia Park, which is higher than Collingwood's home team score. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.

648	Refuted; the home team score of Collingwood was 12.16 (88) and that of Carlton was 10.16 (76), so Collingwood's home team score was only 1.33 points higher than Carlton's home team score, not 2.00 points higher.
649	Supported. According to the table, in the Geelong vs. Hawthorn match played at Kardinia Park, Geelong scored 13.12 (90) points while Hawthorn scored 7.6 (48) points, meaning the home team (Geelong) scored higher than the away team (Hawthorn). This was one of two matches in the table where the home team scored higher than the away team, the other being the Carlton vs. Essendon match played at Princes Park.
650	Refuted. According to the table, Collingwood had a home team score of 12.16 (88), while Geelong had a home team score of 13.12 (90). Therefore, Collingwood's home team score was lower than Geelong's, and not three times higher.
651	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Melbourne had the highest away team score with a score of 94, while Fitzroy had an away team score of 69.
652	Supported. According to the table, St Kilda scored 13.14 (92) while Fitzroy scored 9.15 (69), which means the home team score did not equal the away team score at Junction Oval.
653	Refuted. Although both teams played in the same round, Collingwood's home team score (12.16) was actually 3.16 points higher than that of Carlton (10.16).
654	Supported. Among the six games in the table for the 1954 VFL Season, the home team won in three games: Geelong, Collingwood, and St. Kilda. In the game between Geelong and Hawthorn, which was held at Kardinia Park, Geelong's score of 13.12 (90) was higher than Hawthorn's score of 7.6 (48). Therefore, Kardinia Park was one of three venues where the home team score was higher than the away team score.

730	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, South Dragons had 13 wins and 2 losses in their home record, and Melbourne Tigers had 11 wins and 4 losses in their home record, meaning that they have the same number of wins at home, which is 11.
731	Supported. According to the table, the New Zealand Breakers lost 12 games and had a win percentage of 60%, while the Melbourne Tigers lost 10 games and had a win percentage of 66.67%.

The match with the highest attendance was actually against Sheffield United, listed in row 41, which had an attendance of 38,433.
741	Supported. According to the table, there were four games where Sheffield Wednesday did not score any goals and neither did their opponent.

746	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Olga Govortsova won a grand slam tournament match in 3 out of 5 years (in 2008, 2009, and 2010), but failed to do so in 2007 and 2011.
747	Supported. Looking at the table, Olga Govortsova's year-end ranking for each year from 2007 to 2011 was consistently lower than the previous year, which supports the statement that her ranking has never gone up during that period.
748	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 4 of the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round of the French Open in both 2008 and 2009.

751	The statement "Olga Govortsova has won at least five grand slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007 - 2011" is refuted by the table. Looking at row 3 to row 6 in the table, it can be seen that Olga Govortsova did not win five grand slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007 - 2011.
752	The statement is refuted by the table. Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking did not consistently go up from 2007 to 2011. It went from 49 in 2007 to 74 in 2010, then dropped further to 114 in 2011.
753	The statement is false. According to the table, Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open in 2008 and 2009 (two years in a row), but only reached the second round in 2010 and 2011. The table doesn't have any information for the 2007 French Open, but it is still not enough to support the statement that Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open for five years in a row.
754	Supported. According to the table, only row 10 shows a draw result, while all the other rows show either a win, loss or a no-contest result.
755	Supported, Tim Lajcik had 9 wins, 4 losses, and 2 draws across all the fights listed in the table. Therefore, the number of wins is greater than the number of losses.

Therefore, the statement that "only two matches were played through three rounds" is not supported by the table.

Moreover, row 10 shows that Tim Lajcik had a record of "4-1-1" after the draw with Ron Waterman at UFC 22, which further confirms that the statement is supported by the table.
760	Supported. According to the table, there were 5 wins, 6 losses, and 1 draw, indicating that there were more losses than wins.
761	The statement is refuted by the table because only one match was played through three rounds, which was the draw against Ron Waterman at UFC 22.
762	I'm sorry, but the statement "the match with the shortest time was won against borislav jeliazkov" is refuted by the table. According to the table, the match with the shortest time was actually won against Joe Campanella, with a time of only 0:18 in the first round. The match against Borislav Jeliazkov ended at 2:23 in the first round.
763	I'm sorry, but the statement "the match with the longest time was won against David Ross" is not supported by the table. The longest match in terms of time was against Osami Shibuya, which lasted for the full three rounds and a total of 5 minutes. Tim Lajcik won his match against David Ross in the first round and the fight lasted for 5 minutes and 36 seconds.
764	Supported. According to the table, Carmelo Anthony was the high scorer for the Denver Nuggets in all 12 games they played in November, except for the game against the Hawks on November 7th. Therefore, he was the leading scorer for 12 out of the 13 games played in November.

769	Supported. According to the table, Carmelo Anthony was the high point scorer in 10 out of the 13 games played by the Denver Nuggets in November, which supports the statement.
770	This statement is refuted by the table. The Nuggets won five out of the six games played at the Pepsi Center during this span, with the only loss being in the game against the Hawks on November 7th.
771	The statement is refuted because according to the table, the highest attendance for a game at the Pepsi Center was 19,359, which was during the November 27 game against the Knicks. However, not all games at the Pepsi Center had an attendance over 19,000. For example, the November 10 game against the Bulls had an attendance of 21,409, which was higher than 19,000. However, the November 4 game against the Nets had an attendance of 15,319, which was lower than 19,000.
772	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the Denver Nuggets did not lose more than one game in a row during November. Their longest losing streak during that month was one game (on November 7th against the Hawks), and they never lost two or more games consecutively.

777	Supported. Raymond Felton led the team in assists on February 1st, 6th, and 24th, as well as tying for the lead on February 6th.
778	Refuted. The table only shows 7 games played during the month of February, in which the Bobcats won 3 and lost 4, resulting in a record of 3 wins and 4 losses during that month. The table does not provide information about the Bobcats' overall record for the entire 2009-10 season.
779	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the Charlotte Bobcats' game against the Washington Wizards on February 9, 2010 was 12376, which is the second lowest attendance figure for a game listed in the table.
780	Supported, because according to the table, Stephen Jackson only led the team in points for 4 out of the 10 games listed in the table (games 48, 49, 51, and 54). Therefore, he led the team in points for less than half the games listed.
781	The statement is refuted. The table does not show any instances of a Bobcats player accumulating 20 rebounds in a single game during the 2009-10 season. The highest rebound total for a Bobcats player in a single game in this season was Nazr Mohammed's 20 rebounds against the Minnesota Timberwolves on February 10, 2010, but that was still not 20 rebounds.
782	The statement is refuted by the table. Raymond Felton actually led the team in assists three times according to the table, on February 6th, February 9th, and February 24th.

785	Supported, as according to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes had 4 losses and 3 losses in 2006 and 2009 respectively, making them losing seasons for the team.

789	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes won 9 out of 10 games in 2007, which is not 50%. Furthermore, they were promoted to a higher division after that season, which means they did not fail to get promoted as the statement suggests.
790	Supported. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes had a losing record (more losses than wins) in the seasons 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2008.
791	The statement is incorrect. The table shows that the highest number of ties by the Dundee Hurricanes was in the 2008 season where they had 3 ties. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
792	Supported. According to the table, the Dundee Hurricanes did not win the same number of games in any season between 2003 and 2009. The number of wins varied between 2 and 9 across the seasons.
793	The table shows information about various superfund sites in Mississippi along with their proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted and fully deleted dates. The statement is "only three of the projects have been completed so far". Refuted. The table only lists two projects under the "construction completed" column, which are the Flowood site and the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc site. Therefore, only two of the projects have been completed so far.
794	Supported. According to the table, two of the projects, Chemfax, Inc. and Potter Co., were proposed but were never listed or completed.
795	Supported. According to the table, the flowood site and sonford products are both listed as Superfund sites in Rankin County, Mississippi.

797	Supported. According to the table, construction was completed on the Flowood site in 1993 and on the Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals project in 1997.

802	The statement is refuted. While the construction for the Flowood site was completed on September 17, 1993, the construction for the Newsom Brothers site was completed much later on August 8, 1997. Therefore, the statement that both constructions were completed during the same time frame of 1993 is not supported by the given table.

823	Supported. According to the table, "Galloway & Upper Nithsdale" won by the Conservative party and "Paisley South" won by the Labour party in the 2003 Scottish Parliament General Election.
824	Supported. According to the table, the constituency of Glasgow Govan had a result of "SNP gain," indicating that the Scottish National Party won that seat in the general election of 2007. The statement accurately identifies Glasgow Govan as one of the four constituencies with a "SNP gain" result.
825	Supported.

829	Supported. According to the table, Glasgow Govan is listed as the 7th constituency with the SNP listed as gaining a result, along with Kilmarnock & Loudoun, Dundee West, Western Isles, and Paisley South. This means that Glasgow Govan is indeed one of the five constituencies where the SNP gained a result in the 2007 Scottish Parliament general election.

According to the table, the total finish values for all the years that Shane Hall participated in are: 24.0 + 26.4 + 27.1 + 24.9 + 25.8 + 35.0 + 27.9 + 27.0 + 35.8 + 31.4 + 40.9 + 38.9 + 43.0 = 397.4. Dividing this sum by the total number of races (163) gives an average finish value of 2.439 -> 33.39.
858	Supported. According to the table, Shane Hall ran 57 races with Hensley Racing (in 2001 and 2002) compared to the other teams he raced for: Stegell Motorsports (45 races), Curb-Agajanian Performance Group (25 races), Jay Robinson Racing (24 races), and Moy Racing/ Jay Robinson Racing (9 races).
859	Refuted. According to the table, Shane Hall had placed top 5 only twice, while placing top 10 five times. Therefore, he placed top 10 more than he placed top 5.
860	Supported. According to the table, in the year 2001, Shane Hall had 33 races and 6 Did Not Finish (DNF) results, which is equal to approximately half of his total races for the year.
861	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the irregular galaxy (row 6) has an apparent magnitude of 14.5, while the two spiral galaxies (rows 3 and 5) have apparent magnitudes of 8.7 and 11.9 respectively. The difference between the apparent magnitude of the irregular galaxy and the two spiral galaxies are 5.8 and 2.6 respectively, which gives an average difference of 2.1. Therefore, the statement is supported by the data in the table.
862	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the spiral galaxy with NGC number 5457 has an apparent magnitude of 8.7, which is the lowest among all the objects listed in the table. This means that spiral galaxies have the *lowest* (not least) apparent magnitude, not the least.
863	Supported. According to the table, there are two entries with "irregular galaxy" listed as the object type. The NGC numbers associated with these entries are 5408 and 5477. Therefore, irregular galaxy has two NGC numbers in the list.
864	Supported. According to the table, the globular cluster (NGC 5466) has an apparent magnitude of 10.5, while the irregular galaxy (NGC 5408 and NGC 5477) have apparent magnitudes of 14.0 and 14.5, respectively. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
865	Refuted. The table shows that NGC 5466 is a globular cluster located in the constellation Boötes with a declination of degree32′04″. However, this is not the second highest declination in the list. NGC 5408, an irregular galaxy located in the constellation Centaurus, has a higher declination of degree22′44″. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
866	Supported. According to the table, the apparent magnitude of the irregular galaxy (row 2) is 14.0, while the apparent magnitude of the globular cluster (row 4) is 10.5. Therefore, the irregular galaxy has an apparent magnitude that is 2.1 higher than the globular cluster.
867	Refuted. According to the table, the spiral galaxy with the highest apparent magnitude has an apparent magnitude of 8.7 (NGC 5457), while the irregular galaxies have the highest apparent magnitudes of 14.0 and 14.5 (NGC 5408 and NGC 5477, respectively). Therefore, irregular galaxies have the most apparent magnitude in the given ngc objects.
868	Supported. According to the table, there are two spiral galaxies listed in the table, and they are both under the constellation of Ursa Major, with NGC numbers 5457 and 5474.
869	Supported. According to the table, NGC 5466, which is a globular cluster, has an apparent magnitude of 10.5, while NGC 5408 and 5477 which are irregular galaxies have apparent magnitudes of 14.0 and 14.5 respectively. Therefore, the globular cluster has a lower apparent magnitude than the irregular galaxies, refuting the statement.
870	The statement is not supported by the table. Although there are two spiral galaxies listed in the table, the declination (j2000) of the spiral galaxy with the highest apparent magnitude is not provided, and therefore it cannot be determined whether the spiral galaxy in row 3 has the second highest declination (j2000) in the list.
871	Supported. According to the table, the match between Melbourne and Carlton on 3 June 1961 at the MCG had a crowd of 49,678, which was the highest attendance recorded among all the matches listed in the table.
872	Supported. According to the table, Kardinia Park is listed along with its corresponding match between Geelong and Footscray on June 3rd, 1961. This indicates that Kardinia Park was one of the six venues used during the 1961 VFL season on June 3rd.
873	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that North Melbourne had a home score of 9.14 (68) in their match against St Kilda and South Melbourne had a home score of 7.8 (50) in their match against Fitzroy.
874	Supported. According to the table, the crowd participation at Lake Oval was 14,500 while at Glenferrie Oval it was 15,000. Therefore, the statement that "Lake Oval venue recorded a lower crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue" is true.
875	Supported. According to the table, the crowd for the North Melbourne vs. St Kilda match at Arden Street Oval was 13,000, while the crowd for the Hawthorn vs. Richmond match at Glenferrie Oval was 15,000, which means that Glenferrie Oval had 2,000 more crowd participants than Arden Street Oval.
876	Supported. According to the table, during the 1961 VFL season, the highest crowd participation was recorded in the match between Melbourne and Carlton, which took place on June 3, 1961 at the MCG with a crowd of 49678. The venue with the second-highest crowd was Arden Street Oval with 13000 people. Therefore, the statement "during the 1961 vfl season, Lake Oval venue recorded the highest crowd participation" is not supported by the table.
877	Supported. According to the table, Kardinia Park is listed as the venue for the match between Geelong and Footscray on 3 June 1961. As such, Kardinia Park is indeed one of the four venues that were put to use on that date.
878	Actually, the statement is incorrect. The table does not mention either North Melbourne or South Melbourne recording scores at home. The table only provides information on the scores, venues, crowds, and dates of matches that were played during the 1961 VFL season. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
879	Supported. According to the table, the crowd participation at Lake Oval was 14,500 while at Glenferrie Oval it was 15,000. Therefore, the statement that "Lake Oval venue recorded a higher crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue" is supported by the table.
880	Sorry, I made a mistake in the previous response. The correct answer is "cannot be determined". While the table presents the attendance figures for each game, it does not provide information about the capacities of the venues, making it impossible to determine which venue had a higher percentage of its capacity filled.
881	The statement is refuted by the table. While there are three ranks listed in the table (sekiwake, ōzeki, and yokozuna), the specific phrase "only two" suggests that there are either more than three or less than two ranks listed in the table.
882	Supported. According to the table, Takamiyama held sumo records from November 1969 to September 1982, which is a time range of 13 years.
883	Supported. According to the table, the total of 22 appears three times, which is more than any other total that appears more than two times.
884	Supported. The first record holder in the table is Hasegawa, whose total of 30 wins was achieved between November 1965 and September 1974. Therefore, the statement "the first record was recorded in November of the year 1965" is supported by the table.
885	Supported. According to the table, the last recorded total for the highest totalling name, Kotonishiki, was in September 1999, and the last recorded total for the lowest totalling name, Kisenosato, was in September 2011. Therefore, both records were last recorded in the month of September.
886	The statement is refuted. The table lists four ranks: "sekiwake", "ōzeki", "yokozuna", and there is also an additional "highest rank" column that lists the highest rank achieved by each sumo wrestler. Therefore, the table has more than three highest ranks listed.
887	Supported. According to the table, Takamiyama's first and last sumo record were in November 1969 and September 1982, respectively. Therefore, the time range between his first and last record is 13 years, which is the shortest among all the sumo wrestlers listed in the table.
888	The statement is refuted. While the total of 31 appears twice (rows 4 and 5), the total of 27 appears three times (rows 7 and 8 and 11). Therefore, the total that appears more than two times is 27, not 31.
889	Supported. According to the table, the first record belongs to Hasegawa, and his record started in November 1965.
890	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the last record for the highest totalling name, Kaiō, was recorded in July 2000 and the last record for the lowest totalling name, Kisenosato, was recorded in September 2011. Therefore, the statement is not correct.
891	Supported. According to the table, there were entries for Equestrian at the Asian Games in the years 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010, which means the event did happen every four years for the specified time frame and there is no entry for 1990, which means it did not occur that year.
892	Refuted. According to the table, the equestrian event has been held in several different cities multiple times. For example, it was held in New Delhi in 1982 and in Guangzhou in 2010. Therefore, the statement that the equestrian event has been located in a different city every year it occurred is not supported by the table.
893	Supported. According to the table, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games in 1982 in New Delhi, which was the first time equestrian was included as a sport at the Asian Games.
894	Sorry, but the statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Takashi Tomura won gold in 1986, Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi won gold in 2006, and Ramzy Al Duhami won gold in 2010. Therefore, there were at least three instances where the same athlete won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.
895	Refuted. The statement that "South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time, in Seoul and Doha" is not supported by the given table. While it does show that the equestrian events were held in Seoul in 1986 and in Doha in 2006, it does not provide information about whether any other country has hosted equestrian events in other editions of the Asian Games.
896	Supported. According to the table, equestrian at the Asian Games occurred in 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010, which is every four years from 1982 to 2010.
897	Refuted. According to the table, the location for the equestrian event at the Asian Games did not change every year. It was held in New Delhi in 1982, Seoul in 1986, Hiroshima in 1994, Bangkok in 1998, Busan in 2002, Doha in 2006, and Guangzhou in 2010. Therefore, the statement that the location changed every year except for 1994 and 1998 is refuted.
898	Supported. According to the table, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the 1982 Asian Games held in New Delhi and also won silver in another year.
899	Supported. Looking at the table, the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year except for 1994 and 1998, when Konoshin Kuwahara and Jin Kanno won the gold medal, respectively.
900	The statement is refuted by the table. While South Korea did host the equestrian events at the Asian Games in Seoul in 1986, they did not do so twice as the events were held in different cities for each edition. The table shows that equestrian events were held in New Delhi (1982), Hiroshima (1994), Bangkok (1998), Busan (2002), Doha (2006), and Guangzhou (2010). Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
901	Supported. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers won 8 out of the 14 games in the 1947 season, finishing with a record of 8-4-2.
902	Supported. According to the table, the first opponent of the San Francisco 49ers in the 1947 season was indeed the Brooklyn Dodgers, in week 1 on August 31, 1947.
903	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the first row shows that the first game of the season was played on August 31, 1947, and the San Francisco 49ers won the game against the Brooklyn Dodgers with a score of 23-7.
904	Supported. According to the table, the 49ers tied two out of the fourteen games they played during the 1947 season.
905	Supported. The table shows that the San Francisco 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons on two occasions - once on September 7th, 1947 and again on November 2nd, 1947.
906	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the 49ers only lost four out of the 14 games they played during the 1947 season.
907	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers' last opponent of the season was the Brooklyn Dodgers, in Week 14 on December 7, 1947.
908	The statement "August 31st 1947 was the date of the last game of the season" is refuted by the table because it shows that the San Francisco 49ers played a total of 14 games during the 1947 season, with their last game on December 7th, 1947 against the Buffalo Bills.
909	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the 49ers lost three out of the fourteen games they played during the 1947 season, not two.
910	Supported. According to the table, the San Francisco 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons once during the 1947 season in Week 2 on September 7, 1947, which they won by a score of 17-14.
911	The statement is not supported by the table. Though Annika Sörenstam and Yani Tseng both won the Women's British Open, the table does not indicate that they won with the lowest number of strokes compared to the other champions. In fact, Karen Stupples won the 2004 Women's British Open with the lowest number of strokes (-19) in the entire table.
912	Supported. According to the table, Yani Tseng was the runner-up in 2008, and became the champion in 2010 and 2011.
913	Supported, according to the table, Se Ri Pak was the champion of the Women's British Open in 2001 and won with a score of 277, -11 to par. Two years after, in 2003, she finished in second place, only one stroke behind Annika Sörenstam.
914	The statement is supported - according to the table, Jiyai Shin did become the champion by beating Inbee Park in the 2012 Women's British Open with a margin of victory of 9 strokes.
915	Sorry, there seems to be a typo in the statement. Could you please check and provide the correct statement so that I can check whether it is supported or refuted by the given table?
916	There are two parts to this statement, so I will answer them separately. Regarding Annika Sörenstam, the table shows that she won the Women's British Open in 2003 with a score of 278 and a to-par of -10. This was not the lowest score in the tournament's history, as Yani Tseng in 2011 and Jeong Jang in 2005 both had lower scores of 272. Therefore, the statement that "Annika Sörenstam won with the lowest number of strokes" is refuted by the table. Regarding Catriona Matthew, the table shows that she won the Women's British Open in 2009 with a score of 285 and a to-par of -3. This was not the lowest score in the tournament's history, as Karen Stupples in 2004 had a lower score of 269. Therefore, the statement that "Catriona Matthew won with the lowest number of strokes" is also refuted by the table.
917	Supported. According to the table, Karrie Webb was the runner up in 2008 and then became the champion in both 2010 and 2011 Women's British Open.
918	Supported. According to the table, Se Ri Pak was the champion of the Women's British Open in 2001 and came in second place two years later, in 2003.
919	Sorry, the statement is incorrect. Jiyai Shin did not win the 2010 Women's British Open, Yani Tseng did. Would you like me to provide any other statement from the table?
920	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Jiyai Shin won the Women's British Open in 2012 and earned £428,650 in prize money while Yani Tseng won the tournament in 2011 and received a winner's share of £392,133. Therefore, Jiyai Shin earned £36,517 more than Yani Tseng in their respective winning years.
921	Supported. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins won 12 games and lost 4 games during the 1983 regular season, which supports the statement that they finished the season with a 12-4 record.
922	Supported. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins won two games during the 1983 season by a score of 12-0 and 37-0 against the Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Colts, respectively. These two games were shutouts, indicating that the Dolphins' defense did not allow any points to be scored by their opponents in these two games.
923	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Miami Dolphins won 9 out of their final 10 games during the 1983 season, with their only loss during that stretch occurring in Week 11 against the New England Patriots.
924	The statement is supported, as we can see from row 13 in the table, the Miami Dolphins scored 38 points against the Cincinnati Bengals. No other game in the season had higher points scored by the Dolphins.
925	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against Baltimore Colts on October 23, 1983 was 32343, which is the lowest attendance figure for any game during the 1983 Miami Dolphins season.
926	The statement is refuted by the table, as according to the table, the Miami Dolphins' defense only recorded one shutout during the 1983 season, in the 12th week of the season against the Baltimore Colts.
927	The statement is refuted by the table. The Miami Dolphins won 9 out of their 16 games in the 1983 season, and their final 10 games were not all victories. They won 7 out of their final 10 games, but they lost 3 of those games.
928	The statement is not entirely accurate. While the Miami Dolphins did score 34 points in two different games during the 1983 season (Week 2 against the New England Patriots and Week 16 against the New York Jets), they also scored 37 points in Week 12 against the Baltimore Colts and 38 points in both Week 6 against the Buffalo Bills and Week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
929	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the game against the Houston Oilers on December 4, 1983, was 39434, which is the lowest attendance figure recorded for a Miami Dolphins game during the 1983 season.
930	Supported. According to the table, on February 27th the Minnesota Wild won with a score of 3-2 against Tampa Bay, and on February 29th they also won with a score of 3-2 against Florida. Therefore, the score was the same (3-2) on both dates.
931	Supported - According to the table, on February 10, 2008, the Minnesota Wild had a score of 2 - 1 against St. Louis, and on February 24, 2008, they had a score of 2 - 1 against Calgary.
932	The statement is refuted because the match on February 12 was won by Edmonton 4-2 with Harding as Minnesota's goaltender, while the match on February 20 was won by Chicago 3-0 with Harding as the goaltender again. Therefore, the decision was not the same in those two matches.
933	This statement cannot be determined by the given table. While the table shows the scores, attendance, and records of the games played by the Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season, it does not provide the number of home and away games played by the team.
934	Supported. According to the table, during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Backstrom was the decision goalie 9 times, while Harding was the decision goalie 2 times. Therefore, Backstrom was the decision goalie eleven times more than Harding.
935	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, they won their game on February 27th against Tampa Bay by a score of 3-2, and they also won their game on February 29th against Florida by a score of 3-2. Minnesota did not lose by more than 2 in either of these games.
936	The statement is refuted because the difference in score between the game on February 10 and February 24 during the 2007-08 Minnesota wild season was only 1 goal in favor of Calgary (2-1). So, the statement is refuted by the table.
937	Refuted. According to the table, the match on February 12 had the score of "2 - 4" while the match on February 20 had the score of "0 - 3". Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.
938	Supported. According to the table, the Minnesota Wild played a total of 15 games during February 2008, out of which 9 were played at home and 6 were played away. Therefore, they played at home more times than they played away during that period.
939	Supported. According to the table, of the 14 games listed, Harding was the winning decision for 4 games while Backstrom was the winning decision for 10 games, meaning that Backstrom was the winning decision more times than Harding during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season.
940	Supported. According to the table, the Detroit Lions won 6 games and lost 8 games during the 1976 NFL season.
941	Supported. According to the table, the lowest attendance figure for a game during the 1976 Detroit Lions season was 42048, which occurred during the game against the New Orleans Saints on November 14, 1976.
942	Supported. According to the table, in Week 3 and Week 9, the Detroit Lions played against the Minnesota Vikings and lost both games with scores of 10-9 and 31-23, respectively. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
943	Supported. According to the table, in Week 7, the Detroit Lions played the Seattle Seahawks and won with a score of 41-14, which was the highest number of points scored by the Lions in a single game during the 1976 season.
944	That statement is supported by the table. During week 8 of the 1976 season, the Detroit Lions played against the Green Bay Packers and won with a score of 27-6, which means the Green Bay Packers scored only 6 points, the least amount of points they scored in any game against the Lions that season.
945	Supported. Based on the table, the Detroit Lions finished the 1976 season with a record of 4 wins and 8 losses.
946	Supported. According to the table, the highest attendance figure recorded was for the game against the New Orleans Saints on November 14, 1976, which was 42,048.
947	Supported. According to the table, the Detroit Lions lost to the Chicago Bears in Week 1 with a score of 10-3 and beat them in Week 11 with a score of 14-10.
948	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the most points scored by the Detroit Lions in a single game during the 1976 season was 41, which occurred during their week 7 game against the Seattle Seahawks. Therefore, the statement "the most points scored by the lions in a single game was 58" is not supported by the table.
949	Refuted. According to the table, the Detroit Lions defeated the Green Bay Packers 27-6 in Week 8, which means the Packers did not score the highest amount of points against the Lions. The Lions' opponent that scored the highest amount of points was the Minnesota Vikings, who defeated them 31-23 in Week 9.
950	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Kentucky Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in four games: Cincinnati, Xavier, Georgia, and Vanderbilt.
951	Supported. According to the table, the wildcats lost two games during the season - against Ole Miss and Tennessee - and in both of those games, they only scored 7 points. Therefore, the statement is correct.
952	The statement is supported by the table. The Kentucky Wildcats football team lost one game in September (the first game of the season against Ole Miss) and two games in November (against Alabama and Tennessee), according to the table.
953	Supported. The table shows that the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats played two games in September, four games in October, and four games in November, which supports the statement.
954	Supported. According to the table, the Kentucky Wildcats outscored Evansville by 36 points, which is the highest point differential between the teams in all of the games played during the 1947 season.
955	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the Wildcats kept only three opposing teams scoreless: Cincinnati, Xavier, and Vanderbilt. Therefore, the statement that the Wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in ten games is not supported by the table.
956	Refuted. According to the table, the Wildcats scored 20, 26, 14, 7, 15, and 36 points in the games that they won.
957	The statement is not accurate. The Wildcats lost only one game in November, but they did not lose two games in September. They lost their first game of the season against Ole Miss on September 20th and won their second game against Cincinnati on September 27th. Therefore, the statement is partially refuted by the table.
958	Supported. According to the table, the Wildcats played four games in September, three games in October, and three games in November. Therefore, the statement that the Wildcats played four games in September, two games in October, and two games in November is supported by the table.
959	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the Kentucky Wildcats outscored 9 Georgia, winning 26-0 and outscoring their opponent by 26 points, which was the highest point difference in any of their games during the 1947 season.
960	Refuted. While it is true that there are a significant number of Fords in the table (including Tyrrell-Ford, Lotus-Ford, McLaren-Ford, March-Ford, Brabham-Ford, and Surtees-Ford), there are also several other constructors such as Ferrari and BRM which are represented. Additionally, there is only one Matra in the table, while there are no Alfa Romeos. Therefore, the statement that Alfa Romeo and Matra tie for the least represented constructors is not supported by the table.
961	Supported. The table shows that out of the 26 drivers who participated in the 1971 South African Grand Prix, three retired due to engine trouble: Emerson Fittipaldi, Dave Charlton, and Alex Soler-Roig. This is the highest number of retirements due to any single issue.
962	That statement is supported by the table. Alex Soler-Roig had the highest starting position of 25, while Howden Ganley had the 24th position and Jackie Stewart was in the 1st position.
963	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the driver who completed the most laps at the 1971 South African Grand Prix was Mario Andretti with 79 laps, followed by Jackie Stewart, Clay Regazzoni, and Reine Wisell, who also completed 79 laps. Therefore, there is a four-way tie for the most laps at 79. However, there is not a two-way tie for the least amount of laps at 5. Only two drivers completed fewer than 10 laps: Alex Soler-Roig and Jo Bonnier, who both completed 5 laps.
964	Supported. As we can see from the table, all drivers who completed fewer than 75 laps retired due to various issues, such as engine trouble, overheating, suspension problems, and more. As a result, they were listed as having retired and no time was listed for them.
965	The statement is refuted by the table. BRM is not the most represented constructor in the table, as they only had 3 drivers retire during the race. Ferrari, with 4 drivers, had the most retirements. Furthermore, the table does not show any ties between Alfa Romeo and Matra, as Alfa Romeo was only represented by one driver who retired, while Matra had one driver finish second.
966	The statement is not supported by the table. The drivers retired due to different reasons such as engine trouble, physical issues, accident, overheating, fuel leak, and gearbox issues. Suspension trouble is not mentioned in the table as a reason for retirement.
967	The statement is refuted. Dave Charlton is not in the first position on the grid; he started in position 16, while Jackie Stewart was in the first position. Additionally, Howden Ganley started in position 24, and John Love started in position 21, meaning neither of them had the highest position on the grid.
968	The statement is refuted by the table. The driver who completed the least amount of laps was Jo Bonnier, who completed only 5 laps before retiring due to suspension issues, and not 7 as stated in the statement. However, there is a four-way tie for the second least amount of laps completed at 22, with Jackie Pretorius being the driver who completed only 22 laps and retired due to engine issues.

1034	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Sanya Richards from the United States set the record for the 400m event with a time of 48.83 on September 4, 2009. Therefore, the record for the 400m event before September 4, 2009 would not be over 48.83.

1377	Supported. According to the table, California 22 was a newly created district and the result was a Republican gain, with John J. Phillips winning 57.6% of the votes and defeating N.E. West who received 42.4% of the votes. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1378	Refuted. According to the table, John J Phillips belonged to the Republican party and he won the California 22 district with 57.6% of the votes, while his opponent N E West belonged to the Democratic party and received 42.4% of the votes.
1379	The statement is incorrect, as the incumbent for district California 10 is Alfred J Elliott, not Cecil R King. Therefore, the result with incumbent Cecil R King in district California 17 is re-elected according to the table.
1380	The statement is unsupported by the table as there is no information in the table about the Democratic Party having a first elected year of 1926. The table only provides information about the incumbents, parties, first elected years, and results of the 1942 United States House of Representatives elections.
1381	I'm sorry, there seems to be an error in the statement you provided. According to the table, there are several candidates from different parties running in the elections for the United States House of Representatives in 1942. Therefore, the statement "there is only one party with candidates being harry lane englebright (r) 57.6% n e west (d) 42.4%" is refuted by the table.
1382	The statement is partially supported by the table. While it is true that one Republican candidate, Thomas Rolph in California 4, was first elected in 1940, there is no data for the other Republican candidates to determine when they were first elected. Therefore, it cannot be established that Republican is the party with first elected being 1940.
1383	The statement is not supported by the table. John H Tolan is listed as the incumbent for California 7 and is reported to have been re-elected, but the result is not reported as a Republican gain of a new seat.

1390	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that José Espinoza (NCA) did not successfully complete any lifts and has "DNF" (Did Not Finish) listed in both the snatch and clean & jerk columns. Therefore, it is not possible for José Espinoza to have a snatch of 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0.

1393	Supported. According to the table, Gene Borek is listed as being from the United States in the "country" column.
1394	The statement is refuted, as players from the United States, New Zealand, and South Africa are tied for 3rd place with a score of 140. While there are three players in 3rd place, none of them are exclusively from the United States or New Zealand as the statement implies.
1395	Supported. The table shows that Jim Colbert, the player in second place, has a score of 70 + 68 = 138.
1396	Supported. According to the table, Johnny Miller is listed in row 5 with a score of 71 + 69 = 140 and a "to par" score of -2, which tied him for third place with Jack Nicklaus and Bob Charles. Therefore, the statement is correct that Johnny Miller placed t3.

1405	The statement is supported. According to the table, Gene Borek is from the United States and his score is better than 77 + 65 = 142, which is the score he achieved in the 1973 U.S. Open golf championship.
1406	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that Gene Borek tied for 6th place, not 3rd place. Although he had a strong second round, finishing with a score of 65, his first round score of 77 put him at even par (T6) with three other players.
1407	Supported. According to the table, 90 games were played for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy between Dartmouth and Princeton.
1408	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the series between Dartmouth and Princeton with the Sawhorse Dollar trophy has only played 90 games. Therefore, fewer than 100 games were played for this series with this trophy.
1409	That statement is supported by the table because in the 2002-03 season, the "cashes" column has a value of 6, and the "match play" column has a value of 2, which is smaller than 13. Additionally, the "events" column has a value of 7 for that season.
1410	The statement "6 cashes has earnings of 39380" is supported by the table. According to the table, in the 2011-12 season, the "none" entry had 10 cashes, and the corresponding earnings were 39380, as stated in the statement.

1413	The statement is not supported by the table. The match that Novák played in Auckland, New Zealand was on January 14, 1996, not October 10, 2004. Furthermore, according to the table, the playing surface for that match was clay, not hard.
1414	The surface for October 10, 2004, was supported as hard according to the table.
1415	Supported. According to the table, the opponent Jiří Novák played against on July 13, 2003, in Gstaad, Switzerland was Roger Federer, and the surface they played on was clay.

1417	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the tournament in which Roger Federer was the opponent was played on a clay surface in Gstaad, Switzerland on July 13, 2003. It was not played on a carpet surface, as stated in the statement.
1418	The statement is supported by the table. The row corresponding to the match on October 10, 2004, in Tokyo, Japan, shows that the surface was hard. The subsequent match listed in the table, on November 3, 2004, in Basel, Switzerland, also indicates that the surface was carpet, and therefore not hard.
1419	Supported. According to the table, the surface for the opponent Roger Federer was clay in their match on July 13, 2003, which is the same surface listed in the table for Jiri Novak's other matches against opponents on that same date in Gstaad, Switzerland.

1428	The statement is refuted by the table. The production number for episode 23 is 120.
1429	Supported. According to the table, "There's Somebody Close Behind You" was filmed in December 1965, which falls within the "Jul / Aug 1966" timeframe mentioned in the statement.
1430	The statement is supported by the table. The driver Lorenzo Bandini for the constructor Ferrari, who started the race from grid 7, completed 105 laps and had a time / retired of +6.18.
1431	The statement is refuted. The table shows that only one driver, Richie Ginther with the BRM constructor, had a time / retired of + 6.18, but it did not occur during a 104-lap race. The race consisted of 105 laps for all drivers. There is no information in the table that supports the claim that a no of grids completed 104 laps.
1432	Supported, according to the table, the cdr for the period 1975 - 1980 is 9.0 and the life expectancy is 61.5.

1435	Supported. According to the table, in the row for the period of 1965 - 1970, there were 998,000 deaths per year and 3,330,000 live births per year.
1436	The statement "in the period 2000 - 2005, there was a TFR of 2.25 and an NC of 13.4" is supported by the table. According to row 12 of the table, during the period 2000 - 2005, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was 2.25 and the Natural Change (NC) was 13.4.
1437	The statement is unsupported. According to the table, there were 3,624,000 live births per year during the period when life expectancy for females was 73.3. This period was from 1995-2000, not from the time when the live births were recorded.
1438	The statement is refuted by the table. The total life expectancy in 1950 - 1955 was 50.9, which is less than 70.1. Also, the cdr in 1950 - 1955 was 15.5, which is less than 32.5.

1440	The statement is supported. According to the table, during the period of 1990-1995 there were 1,058,000 deaths per year and the Crude Death Rate (CDR) was 6.8. This is not the same period with 1,086,000 deaths per year, but the CDR of 22.6 doesn't match with any of the periods provided.
1441	The statement is refuted by the table. During the period where there were 900,000 deaths per year (1950-1955), there were only 1,672,000 natural changes per year, based on the table.
1442	The statement is supported. Looking at the table, we can see that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was in fact 2.45 during the period of 1995-2000. Additionally, during this same period, we can see that the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) was 43. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1443	The statement is refuted by the table. The highest number of live births per year in the table is 3,974,000 during the period from 1980 to 1985. The number of live births in the period from 1975 to 1980 is 3,441,000, which is lower than the number stated in the statement.
1444	The statement is contradictory and does not make logical sense. The table shows that there are 11 members from the Labour panel, there are 10 members nominated by the Taoiseach, and the cultural and educational panel has a minimum value of 0. However, the phrase "nil industrial and commercial panels" contradicts the previous statement and does not provide a clear condition to check for. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table.
1445	Supported. According to the table, Jose Ortiz was a center for the Utah Jazz from 1988-90 and played for Oregon State before joining the Jazz.
1446	The statement is refuted because there is no record of the "Houston Jazz" in the table. There is only the Utah Jazz listed, and Andre Owens was indeed a guard for the Utah Jazz from 2005-06.
1447	The statement is supported. The table lists Andre Owens as a player for the Utah Jazz during the 2005-06 season and notes his school as Houston. Therefore, it can be inferred that Houston had a "Jazz club" during the 2005-06 school year.
1448	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Dan O'Sullivan plays center for the Utah Jazz during the 1990-1991 season, and he attended Fordham University.
1449	Supported, according to the table, Greg Ostertag played the center position for the Jazz from 1995-2004 and then again from 2005-2006.
1450	Supported. According to the table, Greg Ostertag is listed as a center for the Utah Jazz and his school/club team is listed as Kansas.
1451	The statement is refuted by the table. The table states that Greg Ostertag played for the Jazz from 1995-2004 and 2005-06, and his college team was Kansas, not Oregon State. Additionally, the table does not list Josã Ortiz as playing for the Jazz from 1988-90.
1452	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, Andre Owens played guard for the Jazz during 2005-06 and not center.
1453	The statement is refuted by the table because while the Jazz did have a player named Andre Owens from Houston on their roster in 2005-06, he was not a graduate from Turkey. Plus, the only Turkish player listed on the table is Mehmet Okur, who played for the Jazz from 2004-2011, but he did not graduate from a Houston school.
1454	The statement is refuted by the table, as Dan O'Sullivan is listed as being from the United States and having played center for Fordham, rather than going to Kansas.
1455	Supported. According to the table, Mehmet Okur played as a forward-center for the Utah Jazz from 2004-2011 and played for Efes Pilsen (Turkey) before joining the Jazz. Therefore, his position was center for the club team Efes Pilsen (Turkey).
1456	Sorry, I was mistaken. There is no row in the table where the gb value is 5, therefore, it is not possible to determine the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5.
1457	Refuted.
1458	Refuted. While it is possible to calculate the average win percentage of all seasons without a GB of 5, the table does not provide such information. Therefore, we cannot determine if the statement is true or false based on the table.
1459	The table provides some data but not enough to determine the statement. It only gives the win percentage and GB (games back) for each season, and there is no information about how many teams finished with a GB of 5 in 2011 or any other year. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table.
1460	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, Sidney R Yates was the Democratic incumbent for Illinois 9, and he was first elected in 1964. The row also indicates that he was re-elected in the 1974 elections. Therefore, the statement "the fourth elected incumbent Sidney R Yates was in 1964" is true.
1461	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Sidney R. Yates was the incumbent from the Democratic Party in Illinois 9 and was re-elected in the 1974 House of Representatives elections. There is no mention of him being from the Republican Party or representing Illinois 10 in the table.
1462	Supported. According to the table, Leanne Baker was the runner-up in the final on hard surface against Mirielle Dittmann on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand.
1463	Supported. According to the table, Leanne Baker won on May 2, 1999, in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, and the surface was listed as hard.
1464	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the opponent in the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on hard surface was not Katerina Kramperova but Mirielle Dittmann, and Leanne Baker ended up as the runner-up with a score of 6-7 (5) 6-1 6-7 (5).
1465	The statement is refuted. According to the table, the surface on 2 May 1999 in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico was hard, not grass.
1466	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, volume 5, of 4 episodes took place on September 19, 2006, in Region 1. However, the table does not show that it took place on this date in Region 1. It indicates that it was released on September 19, 2006, in Region 1, but it does not provide information about where it took place.
1467	Supported. According to the table, each volume only contains one disc, so the highest number of discs released for any of the volumes is indeed only 1.
1468	Supported. According to the table, the 5th volume of "none" was released in region 1 on September 19, 2006 and it had 4 episodes.

1472	The statement is supported. According to the table, volume 5 has 1 disc, 4 episodes, and a region 1 release date of May 30, 2006.
1473	The statement is refuted by the table. The table shows that all volumes of "none" have only 1 disc, not 2 discs. Additionally, the table does not provide information on the number of episodes per disc, so it cannot confirm or refute that part of the statement.
1474	Refuted. According to the table, the region 1 episode for September aired on September 19, 2006, while the region 2 episode for the same month aired on May 26, 2008, which is later than the region 1 airing.
1475	The statement is unsupported. According to the table provided, there is only one disc listed for each volume of "none".
1476	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that each volume of "none" had exactly 4 episodes, and the highest number of episodes in Region 2 was 4 for all volumes. Additionally, March 15, 2007, only pertains to the Region 4 release of Volume 1 and is not related to the number of episodes.
1477	Supported. According to the table, in 1996, VCU Rams men's basketball had a record of 24-9 and were in the Southeast region.
1478	The statement is partially supported. While it is true that the VCU Rams had a record of 29 - 7 in 2012 and 27 - 9 in 2013, 2012 did not set a record for the year with the highest score. In fact, the Rams had a better record of 28 - 12 in 2011. Therefore, the second part of the statement is supported but the first part is refuted.
1479	Supported. According to the table, in 2011, VCU Rams men's basketball team had a record of 28-12, and they played in the Southwest region. Their results are listed in row 11, which shows that they won a total of 5 games and lost 1 game in the region, creating the mentioned record.

1481	Supported. According to the table, the earliest year in which VCU Rams men's basketball had a record of 18-12 was 1980.
1482	The statement is refuted. Although the 2012 team received a 12 seed, they did have a record of 29-7 which was the best record listed in the table.
1483	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, VCU Rams Men's Basketball had a record of 27 - 9 in the year 2011, where they won five games and lost one game during the NCAA tournament with the results of "w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61" and later they lost with the results of "l 62 - 70".
1484	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the record of "l 72-86" was achieved in the year 1980, which is not larger than 1996. Additionally, the seed for this record is specified as 12, which is not less than 12. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the table.

1487	The statement is supported by the table, as we can see in row 2, "David Duchovny" won the "Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series" award in the year 1996 for his role as "Fox Mulder" in "The X-Files".
1488	Supported. According to the table, David Duchovny was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama Series in 1997.
1489	Supported. According to the table, the earliest year when the result is nominated (for any category) and the role/episode is Fox Mulder is in 1996, when David Duchovny won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series for his portrayal of Fox Mulder.
1490	The statement is refuted by the table. There is no year listed in the table where the role/episode is specifically identified as "David Duchovny".

1500	Supported. According to the table, the result for the voting district of Maryland 7 is "re-elected" and the incumbent, Parren Mitchell, ran unopposed.

1533	Supported. According to the table, the nation with the smallest rank and at least 1 gold was Japan, which had a rank of 1 and 5 golds. The nation with 1 gold and a smaller rank than 2 does not exist in the table.
1534	Supported. According to the table, South Korea did not earn any gold medals in the 1967 World Judo Championships.
1535	Supported. According to the table, no country received 4 bronze medals at the 1967 World Judo Championships. The highest number of bronze medals a country received was 2 (which was earned by both Germany and South Korea).
1536	The statement is refuted. According to the table, South Korea did not win any gold medals at the 1967 world judo championships, they won one silver and two bronze medals. Japan won the most gold medals with five.
1537	Sorry, the statement is refuted. According to the table, the fifth rank has a total of 2 bronze medals and 1 silver medal.

1543	Supported. According to the table, Jai Lewis had a rebound average of 7.2 during his 125 games, which is when he held the rank of 7.

1545	Supported. According to the table, the player George Evans has a rank of 4 and a total rebound of 953, which is less than the 805 total rebounds with Rob Rose as a player and a rank of 8. Therefore, there are zero rebounds with George Evans as a player and a rank larger than 8.
1546	The statement is refuted because Herb Estes has 734 rebounds, not 708, as shown in row 9 of the table.
1547	The statement is refuted because the player with rank 10 (Jesse Young) has a rebound average of 6.2 but has only played in 115 games, which is less than the required 124 games in the statement. Therefore, the table does not support the statement.
1548	Supported. According to the table, Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24 with a score of 108 - 111 in overtime.

1552	Supported. According to the table, Isabel Cueto played against Katerina Maleeva in the final of the Sofia tournament on July 31, 1989, and the final score was 6-2, 7-6 (3).
1553	The statement "9 july 1990 was the date the opponent in the final was katerina maleeva" is refuted by the table. According to the table, Isabel Cueto played against Barbara Paulus in the final on 9 July 1990, not Katerina Maleeva.
1554	The statement is incorrect. The table does not show a score of "6-2, 7-5" for the opponent against Katerina Maleeva in the final. The score shown in the table is "6-2, 7-6 (3)" for Isabel Cueto against Katerina Maleeva in the final of the Sofia, Bulgaria tournament on July 31, 1989. Therefore, the statement is refuted by the table.
1555	Supported. According to the table, all teams with 3 losses (Montreal Hockey Club, Ottawa Hockey Club, Montreal Victorias, and Quebec Hockey Club) have 0 ties, which supports the statement.

1562	The statement is refuted by the table. According to the table, the episode with production code 2arg24, "See You Next Fall," was not directed by Michael Spiller, but rather by Steven Levitan.
1563	Sorry, there seems to be an error in the provided table. Row 23 has the production code "2arg24" and not "2arg01", so the statement "the production code for see you next fall is 2arg01" is refuted by the table.
1564	This statement is supported by the table. Looking at the "totals" row, we can see that there are no wins (the "wins" column is 0) when the "top-25" column is less than 4. Additionally, there are no wins when the "top-10" column is less than 4, but this is not explicitly stated in the statement.
1565	The statement is not supported by the table. The table shows that Chris DiMarco has not won any PGA Championship when his top-25 finish is less than 4, and he has made 6 cuts in such events. However, it does not provide any information regarding his top-5 finish at those events.
1566	Supported. According to the table, the away team when the crowd was 28158 was Essendon, so the statement is true.

1568	The statement is refuted. There is no row in the table where Hawthorn is the home team.
1569	Sorry, but I'm unable to determine whether the statement is supported or refuted by the table about "none" as there is no entry with a rating / share of 3.2 / 8 in the table. The highest rating / share is 3.8 / 10 with 11.97 million viewers, but the rating / share values for the last two entries are marked as "n / a".
1570	Supported. According to the table, Olimpia had 2 wins during the 2005 season and they finished in the 10th position.
1571	Supported. None of the teams in the top 3 positions scored less than 21 goals each, but the teams in the bottom 3 positions scored fewer goals, particularly General Caballero ZC and Olimpia who only managed to score 16 and 10 goals respectively. Since Olimpia is in the 10th position, which is the lowest position, the statement "the total number scored of the team positioned higher than 10 is zero" is true.
1572	Supported. According to the table, Croatia won a total of 3 medals at the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships, with 2 of them being silver.
1573	Supported. According to the table, Australia did not receive any gold medals in the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships.

Additionally, the row containing the game at the Verizon Center shows a record of 41-36, not 49-36.

1587	Supported. According to the table, Cole Sprouse was nominated for the Favorite TV Actor category in both the 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards.
1588	The statement is refuted by the table because according to the table, "The Suite Life on Deck" was only nominated for the "Teen Pick Show: Comedy" category at the Hollywood Teen TV Awards in 2010, but did not win. It was "Glee" that won the award in that category that year.
1589	The statement is supported by the table. The table shows that while both the 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards nominated Dylan Sprouse for the Favorite TV Actor category, Cole Sprouse was only nominated for the same category in 2010 and was not nominated for the category in 2011. Therefore, the statement that neither the 2010 nor the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards nominated Cole Sprouse for the Favorite TV Actor category is correct.
1590	The statement is supported by the table as it shows that the game against the New Orleans Saints on October 28, 2001 had an attendance of 66189 and the St. Louis Rams had a record of 6-1 at that point in the season.
1591	Supported. According to the table, the attendance for the Indianapolis Colts game on December 30, 2001 was 66084.0.

1597	The statement is false. According to the table, on February 17, 2008, the score was 3-2 and the result was also 3-2. On March 3, 2010, the score was 2-0 and the result was also 2-0. However, there is no date in the table where the score was 2-0 and the result was 3-2 at the same time.
1598	Sorry, the statement is refuted. According to the table, the score of the 2010 world cup qualification match was 1-0, not 2-1.
1599	The statement is refuted as there is no game in the table that has a final score of 4-1 and a venue of London, England.

1603	Supported. According to the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranked as the 3rd busiest airport in terms of total cargo traffic with 2,939,157 metric tonnes of cargo.
1604	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, rank 16 is "London Heathrow Airport" with a code (iata / icao) of "lhr / egll". The airport with the code (iata / icao) of "ord / kord" is "O'Hare International Airport" which is actually ranked 18 in the table.
1605	Supported. According to the table, Shanghai Pudong International Airport has the third-highest total cargo of all airports listed, with a total cargo of 2939157 metric tonnes, when ranked by cargo traffic.
1606	Supported. The table shows that Cologne Bonn Airport had a 0.5% increase in cargo, which means that the statement claiming a 0.1% increase is accurate.

1608	Supported. According to the table, Brian Finch finished in the 7th position with a time of 2:14.59.0, which is greater than rank 3.
1609	The statement is refuted. According to the table, Brian Finch rode for the Velocette team, not the Suzuki team. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have a time value for the Suzuki team, and the statement cannot be supported by the given data.
1610	Supported. According to the table, episode number 54 "the queen's gambit job" was written by M Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch.
1611	Supported, according to the table, series number 50, "The Carnival Job", had 3.38 million viewers.
1612	False. While Dean Devlin did direct one episode in season 1 ("The Long Way Down Job"), he did not direct all of the episodes in season 1. Therefore, the statement that "season 1 is directed by Dean Devlin" is refuted by the table.
1613	The statement is refuted by the table. While Marc Roskin directed several episodes of Leverage, including "The 15 Minutes Job," "The Hot Potato Job," "The Carnival Job," "The Experimental Job," "The Girls' Night Out Job," and "The Gold Job," the table only provides information about the directors for individual episodes, not for entire seasons. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed from the table whether or not Marc Roskin directed all the episodes in Season 1 of Leverage.
1614	Sorry to inform you that the statement "the 10 li'l grifters job directed by marc roskin originally aired july 3 , 2011" is refuted by the table. According to the table, "the 10 li'l grifters job" was directed by Arvin Brown and aired on July 3, 2011. The director of the episode was not Marc Roskin, but Arvin Brown.
1615	Sorry, the statement is not supported by the table. The Gold Job was actually directed by Marc Roskin, not by Arvin Brown, and it was viewed by 2.26 million viewers, not 3.22 million.
1616	Supported. According to the table, in the years 1996 to 2011, there were three instances when the reader's vote and lifetime achievement columns were both marked as "na": 1998, 2000, and 2011.
1617	Supported. According to the table, the Lifetime Achievement category in the 1998 Ned Kelly Awards was not awarded to any specific individual or work, and is listed as "na."
1618	Supported. The table shows that the winners of the lifetime achievement award after 2005 were Andrew Rule and John Silvester in 2006, Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson in 2007, Marele Day in 2008, Shane Maloney in 2009, and Peter Doyle in 2010. Therefore, the statement is supported by the table.
1619	Supported. According to the table, there is no winner listed for the reader's vote in the 2011 Ned Kelly Awards, and instead "na" (not applicable) is shown. Therefore, the statement that "in 2011, n/a was the reader's vote" is supported by the table.
1620	That statement is supported by the table. As per the table, there is no mention of "na" winning the lifetime achievement award before the year 1998. However, in 1998, the lifetime achievement column is labeled as "na", which gives the impression that no one was selected for the award that year. Therefore, the statement "na won the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998" is supported by the given table.
1621	I'm sorry, but the statement cannot be supported or refuted by the table. The table only shows the winners in each category for each year of the awards, but it does not provide enough information to determine if Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day are the only ones to win the lifetime achievement award while somebody else won the best non-fiction and reader’s vote awards after 2005. The table does not show the winners in those categories for the years after 2005, and it does not provide any information on lifetime achievement award winners who did not win in the other categories.
1622	Supported. According to the table, in 2011, the winner for the best teenage/young adult, best non-fiction, and lifetime achievement categories were not mentioned, so the "na" placeholder applies to all three categories. However, it is indicated that there was a reader's vote, and "na" does not appear in that category, which means that "na" did not win the reader's vote in 2011. Therefore, the statement "na only won the reader's vote in 2011" is supported by the table.
1623	The statement is not supported by the table. According to the table, there were five occasions when the reader's vote and lifetime achievement categories were both marked as "na" (1998, 2000, 2003, 2004, and 2011), which is not "over three times."
1624	The statement "the home media center had no os x" is refuted by the table as seen in row 12 of the table which indicate that the Home Media Center is available on the Windows operating system as well as on Unix-like systems, which likely includes macOS (formerly OS X).
1625	The statement that "Coherence has partial windows" is supported by the table. According to the table, Coherence has a "partial" rating in the "Windows" column, indicating that it has limited functionality or compatibility with that operating system.
1626	Supported. According to the table, the license for Rygel is lgplv2 in row 28.
1627	The statement "the home media center had no os x and windows" is refuted by the table, as it shows that the Home Media Center had support for the Windows operating system.
1628	The statement "coherence is the name when windows and web interface are partial" is supported by the table. According to the table, under the "name" column, "coherence" is written in the row that has "partial" under the "windows" and "web interface" columns.
1629	The statement is supported by the table. According to the table, the license for Rygel is lgplv2, which stands for Lesser General Public License version 2, which is a type of GPL or GNU General Public License.
1630	The statement "GPL is the license for JRiver Media Center" is refuted by the table. According to the table, JRiver Media Center is a proprietary software (prop) and not licensed under the GPL.

1634	Supported. According to the table, in tie no. 6, Shrewsbury Town was the home team and their score was 1 - 0 against Wimbledon on 26/01/1991.
1635	Supported. According to the table for the "1990-91 FA Cup", in row 8 the home team was Woking, the tie number was 5, and the score was 0-1 in favor of Everton, which supports the statement.

1640	The statement is supported by the table. According to row 2 of the table, on July 13th, the third set of the match had a score of 12-25.
1641	Supported, according to the table, when set 3 was 18 - 25, the total score was indeed 53 - 75, as shown in row 6.
1642	The statement "the set 2 of 16 - 25 was on 15 jul" is supported by the table as row 6, which corresponds to the match on 15 jul, shows that the set 2 score was 19 - 25, not 16 - 25.
1643	The statement is supported by the table. Row 4 shows that the score was 1-3 and the total was 70-97. The third set score was 15-25. Therefore, the statement that "set 3 was 25-13 when the total was 75-34" is false.

1647	The statement "on 21 august 1943, North Melbourne was the away team at Glenferrie Oval" is refuted by the table. According to the table, on 21 August 1943, North Melbourne played against Carlton at Princes Park, not at Glenferrie Oval where Hawthorn played South Melbourne.

The table does support this statement as we can see that on the 19th of October the Guildford Flames played a home game against the Romford Raiders, and on the 22nd of October they played an away game against the Wightlink Raiders. Therefore, the Wightlink Raiders were not the opponent at the home game, but at the away game. The statement is refuted.

1796	The statement "por has a free transfer fee" is supported by the table about "2008 - 09 apoel f.c. season". The table does not list any transfer fee for Paulo Costa, who was on a mutual consent loan return to Anorthosis Famagusta, indicating that the transfer was free of cost.

1808	Sorry, I made a mistake in my previous response. As an AI language model, I cannot infer if any statement is true, false, supported or refuted without appropriate context. However, based on the table about "2008 - 09 segunda división b", the statement "in the 28 matches that Miguel Zapata played, he scored only 17 goals" is not supported, since the table shows that Miguel Zapata was a goalkeeper who conceded 17 goals in 28 matches that he played, not scoring any.

1862	Supported.
1863	Supported. According to the table, the production code for the episode with 24.8 million US viewers is 467663, which is episode 13 titled "The One with Chandler's Work Laugh." Therefore, the production code 467671 does not have 24.8 million US viewers.
1864	The statement "October 1, 1998 was the date that the one with all the resolutions originally aired" is not supported by the table.

1873	Supported. According to the table, the team with 9 blank ends lost 43 ends. However, the statement is not entirely accurate since "ends lost" refers to the number of ends that the team conceded to their opponent, whereas "blank ends" refers to the number of ends where neither team scored any points.
1874	The statement is refuted by the table. Although the table shows that Prince Edward Island scored 67 points (pf) during the tournament, there is no information in the table that states they lost 40 ends.

1888	The statement is false, according to the table.
