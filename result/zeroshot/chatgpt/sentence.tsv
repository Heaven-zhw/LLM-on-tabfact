While the table does include two players with the last name Dawkins (Darryl and Paul), they played for the team in different years, with Darryl playing in 1987-88 and Paul playing in 1979-80. However, Paul Dawkins is listed as a guard while Darryl Dawkins is listed as a center, so the statement is also incorrect in describing them both as guards.

While rows 1 and 23 also have a replication site in the nucleus, they are not assigned to a specific group or Baltimore classification, so they are not included in the count. However, there is a 9th family, hepadnaviridae, with a replication site in the nucleus, which brings the total to 9 viral families with a replication site in the nucleus.
119	Supported.
120	Supported. The table shows that both Herpesviridae and Poxviridae have a complex virion shape.
121	Supported. Upon reviewing the table, it can be seen that 13 viral families have an icosahedral virion shape - Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, Reoviridae, and the unassigned group with a spherical shape.

125	Supported. The table shows that eight of the families listed (Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) are non-enveloped.
126	The statement is not supported by the table as there are multiple viral diseases in Baltimore group III (Reoviridae).
127	The statement is supported by the table. Row 23 states "unassigned" under the "family" column, indicating that a viral disease in this group has not been assigned to a family.
128	Supported. Rows 9-23 indicate that 9 viral families have a replication site in the cytoplasm.
129	Refuted. Only 3 viral families (Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Hepadnaviridae) out of the total 24 have a replication site in the nucleus.

132	Supported. The table shows that seven viral families (Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, and Picornaviridae) have an icosahedral virion shape.
133	Supported. Rows 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 show that these viral families replicate in the cytoplasm, which is outside the nucleus.
134	Supported. None of the viral diseases listed in the table has a virion shape described as spherical in any of the rows.
135	Supported. The table shows that eight viral families have an enveloped virion shape (Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Retroviridae).
136	The statement is not supported by the table as there is no indication in the table of which viral diseases belong to Baltimore group III.
137	This statement cannot be determined from the given table as there is no information on how many viral diseases are associated with each family/group.
138	The statement is refuted by the table as Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 tournaments on a hard tennis court, but the number of games she played on a hard court is not mentioned.
139	The statement cannot be supported or refuted by the given table as it only lists five matches played by Galina Voskoboeva, and does not provide a complete record of all her matches.
140	There is insufficient information in the table to support or refute the statement as there are only three matches listed on clay and two matches listed on hard court.
141	Supported. The table shows that Galina Voskoboeva played against different opponents in each tournament listed.
142	The statement is not supported by the table. The table only provides information about the outcomes of five matches played by Galina Voskoboeva and their corresponding scores. It does not contain any data on the average number of points she scores or loses in her matches.
143	Refuted. Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 2 games on a hard tennis court and 2 on clay.
144	The statement is refuted by the table. Galina Voskoboeva played 40% of her games on a clay top tennis court and 40% on hard.
145	The statement is refuted by the table. While Galina Voskoboeva has played on both clay and hard courts, she has only won tournaments on hard courts (Mont-de-Marsan in 2003 and Pittsburgh in 2006). Additionally, she has been a runner-up in tournaments on both clay and hard courts. Therefore, her winrate is not equal between the two surfaces.
146	Supported. Looking at the table, there is only one instance (6 June 2006) where Galina Voskoboeva played the same opponent twice (Alice Canepa).
147	Unsupported. The table only provides the scores of the matches and not the individual points won by each player, so it is not possible to determine the average number of points that Voskoboeva loses against Kravets and Canepa.

While Learco Guerra was the race leader after the first stage (Milan to Turin), he regained the race leader position after stage 4 (Pisa to Florence) before losing it again to Jef Demuysere after stage 7 (Florence to Grosseto). Therefore, he did become the race leader again later in the circuit.
153	Supported. According to the table, Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 out of the 25 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia.
154	Supported. The table shows that Alfredo Binda won seven races of the 1933 Giro d'Italia and was the race leader for 15 races.

156	The statement is refuted by the table. Although Ettore Meini won two stages on May 24th and May 25th, he did not win on May 26th during the 1933 Giro d'Italia. Alfredo Binda won on May 26th and was the race leader throughout the entire event.
157	The statement is refuted by the table. Learco Guerra was the race leader only for the first stage of the race, but after that, Alfredo Binda became the race leader and retained the position until the end of the race.
158	The statement is supported by the table.
159	Supported. Wes Roberts was picked in the 7th round with the 170th overall pick, while Ed Whitley was picked in the 11th round with the 280th overall pick.
160	Supported - There is only one player from Clemson (Marvin Sims) and two players from USC (Ray Butler and Chris Foote) in the table, so more players were drafted from USC.
161	The statement is unsupported by the table as there is at least one player in the running back position (Curtis Dickey) who was picked in the 1st round, and there is no mention of rounds after the 12th round in the table.
162	Supported. Curtis Dickey was picked in the 1st round (5th overall), while Randy Bielski was picked in the 12th round (311th overall).
163	The statement is supported by the table as there is a row indicating that 2 players were picked in the 2nd round of the draft.
164	The statement is refuted by the table as neither Wes Roberts nor Ed Whitley were picked in the 3rd round.
165	Refuted - The table only includes one player each from USC and Clemson, so neither college had the most players drafted at 3.
166	The statement is refuted by the table. There was only one running back position picked (Curtis Dickey) and he was picked in the first round.
167	The statement is refuted by the table as Curtis Dickey was picked in Round 1 at pick 5 and Randy Bielski was picked in Round 12 at pick 6.
168	Supported. Italy received 2 gold medals, which is 2 more than Canada's 0 golds, and tied with the United States and West Germany for 9th place in terms of gold medals won. However, the table does not provide information about Italy receiving more gold medals than Canada.
